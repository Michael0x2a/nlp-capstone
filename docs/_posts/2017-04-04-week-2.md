My team name is "Team Inverted Cat". 

My github repo can be found at [https://github.com/michael0x2a/nlp-capstone][0].

My current plan is to be in startup mode.

## Proposal 1:

**Description:** My first project idea is to detect abusive language in online 
discussions using deep learning.

**MVP:** Although I haven't yet determined what deep learning architectures 
I'd like to try using, I'll probably start by experimenting with LSTMs and 
other similar architectures.

It also turns out using character-level n-grams with logistical regression is 
[evidently a somewhat reasonable approach][1], so I plan on implementing that
as my baseline/strawman approach.

**Other notes:** I plan on starting by using these two dataset from Wikipedia 
([methodology description][2]):

- [https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Detox_Data/4054689][2a]
- [https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Toxicity/4563973][2b]

An interesting extension would be to try and _predict_ topics that are likely 
to trigger abusive comments -- pragmatically speaking, it might be more 
effective for moderators to predict likely targets of abuse and act 
preemptively, rather then reacting after-the-fact or over-relying on tools.

    
## Proposal 2:

**Description:** My second project proposal is to experiment with using 
stylistic transfer of text -- can I make a textbook sound like Shakespeare, or 
make an instruction manual sound like rap?

There has been some recent work done on stylistic transfer with images and
movies; I'm interested in seeing if it's possible to do the same with text,
possibly incorporating various ideas from machine translation.
    
**MVP:** I plan on starting by studying and existing image style transfer
neural network implementations, building or searching for a dataset 
(perhaps using Wikipedia, as described below), and evaluating how effective
a straightforward adaptation is. I also plan on experimenting with
adversarial neural networks (if I haven't yet already in a previous step).

**Other notes:** The most immediately challenging aspect of this will be 
finding good datasets to train on. One possible approach might be to scrape 
articles from both the regular English wikipedia and the Simple English 
wikipedia and attempt to learn a "simple" or "complex" style.

I also found [this article][3], which conducted some preliminary research and
has links to various sources and papers that may be applicable for stylistic
transfer of text I can explore later.

## Proposal 3:

**Description:** My third project proposal is to attempt to train a model
that performs well on Microsoft's [MSMARCO][4] dataset.

**MVP:** I plan on starting somewhat stereotypically, by reproducing
the baseline results using the methodology described on the website, and 
by training an RNN with attention, then move on to implementing and adapting
more complex architectures after conducting more research.
