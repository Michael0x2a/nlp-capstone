## Software

I've currently downloaded and am experimenting with Tensorflow/working through
it's tutorial. I've had a little bit of prior exposure using Tensorflow 
from taking the grad NLP course with Yejin last quarter, but it was nice 
to refamiliarize myself with how it works.

I've also requested, provisioned, and set up a GCE instance with two GPUs
on Google Compute, and have completed a tutorial or two there.

My Thursdays tend to be relatively busy, so I plan on making more progress
over the weekend/before Tuesday.

I'm currently planning on exploring my abuse detection project first, then
exploring the style transfer idea. So far, I've done some preliminary
work on setting up the baseline character-based ngram comparison model
(mostly copied-and-pasted from an old assignment).
