Evil exists. And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan.   The ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism.   A lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism.   The antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies.

I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.  :However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.  :Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.  :And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.  :The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.  :The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.  :Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start.

On the plus side it is clear. On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.) Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information. My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person): An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?  Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)? Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?  It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 4126589, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 1.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 2212, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 175, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 86, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 263, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 286, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 426, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 438, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 541, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 784, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 82, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 883, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 945, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 1025, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 81, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 1939, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 1638, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 1269, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 4126589, "2": 873, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.10526315789473684, "1": 4132387, "2": -1, "3": -0.05263157894736842}, "2": "  PS.

In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical.  Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature.  On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass.  Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena.  If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole.  You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break.  However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop.  Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields.  Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used.  For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass.  Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa.  Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers.

Do you know where I can find this policy? I'd like to point another user to it, Dittaeva, who goes on major monosyllabic keep sprees from time to time.  Also, sorry to bother you with this, but is there any reasonable way of accessing a VfD debate that is as old as Jan 2004? Anthony talked in the current Hubert Dreyfus debate about this being ``worse than when Sidney Morgenbesser was listed here and deleted.`` For a deleted article, Sidney Morgenbesser was surprisingly bluelinked, I thought, so I went look. Oh, my, what a terrible article. Consists of unpleasant anecdotes and fake references. The subject is a professor  with writer's block. Anyway, the point is, it was put up for deletion 23 Jan 2004, subsequently deleted, and then recreated in  August 2004 (as a stub, by Gzornenplatz.) Anthony added material to it on 15 August. So I wanted to put it up for speedy, but the relevant criterion says ``reposted content that was deleted according to Wikipedia deletion policy`` can be speedied, and how can I tell what the content was? The recreated article probably doesn't in fact technically speaking have the same content, since everybody called the old one ``vanity`` (there's a maybe incomplete record of the Januaray voting on User_talk:Anthony_DiPierro#Stop_the_vanity_insanity|this]] subpage of Anthony's), and the new one is much weirder than that. Oh, look, a learned cunt joke by Christopher Hitchens, how delightful.  Anyway. I wanted to see the Jan voting for myself \u2014 Anthony doesn't claim that the copy of it  on  his page is complete \u2014 so I tried to burrow back through the huge VfD archive that was created in  May, but it broke when I was about halfway. So that was a wasted half-hour. -( There's got to be an easier way. Or maybe not?  Anyway, good morning George. I shouldn't be doing this, I (despairingly) have other things to do. Urgent things. OK, today I'll  list Anthony's baby Sidney Morgenbesser for either speedy or VfD (yes, I will, if it's at all possible, i. e. if you have any answers for my questions above), and cleanup Reverse sexism and read that urgent dissertation chapter.

It makes sense that a nation would extol the virtues of itself, right?  The PRC does not have a cult of personality, does not glorify male youth as fighters, does not glorify female youth as future incubators.  Mysticism is missing from official Chinese pronouncements too.  Also missing is the stated goal of said society.  Left Totalitarian regimes like China see a future where a hierarchy of work-production, and distribution can be overcome once production is more automated with robotics and technology and economic scarcity can be overcome.  Allowing private property is a means towards an end in the case of China (market socialism).  Right Totalitarian regimes see hierarchy as the natural and permanent order of things, and the existence of private property is not a mean to an end, but the end to be preserved within itself.  A broad definition of fascism which would more correctly have to be termed corporatism if we say that mysticism, gender roles, and ideological heritage/stated aims aren't necessary conditions, then that would also allow us to place countries like the U.S since the 1930's, social-democratic Germany, and Keynesian Japan in that category. The main difference between fascism and capitalist-democratic or more benign corporatist states is the right for trade unions and combinations to engage in collective bargaining and even work stopages (strikes) against the immediate consent of the state or business.   Unions have this right in China today, to a limited extent, as in the U.S to a limited extent.  On an economic basis, Germany may be considered more corporatist or economically interventionist than the U.S, but politically the citizens have more rights to protest and engage in collective bargaining or form new unions. Unless I can be swayed from this line of thought, and I am open to it, I will mercilessly edit out grouping the PRC as fascist.

Since you're in the area why don't you go and check - I haven't been up there for about 18 months so things may have been cleaned up, but it didn't look too hopeful since it has been in that state for at least the last ten years. I'd check myself but I actually reside in Australia, so a quick trip is not really feasible right now. If I'm wrong I'll be more than happy to retract my statement, but since the problems appear to be somewhat entrenched, I'm not too hopeful. The area I'm thinking of in particular is the section of Livingstone Walk between Henry Wells Square and the main residential section - there was a major park there that is now closed and unquestionably surrounded by barbed wire. Further on is The Dell which when I visited last was strewn with houshold rubbish and used syringes. I don't think the evidence of my own eyes counts as 'POV'. As for the implication that I might simply be lying about this - why would I want to do that? These places are not the only examples - a tour of the area on foot will confirm what I'm suggesting. As for the CCTV info, it may be true, but it isn't actually very interesting, nor is it worded in a way which makes much sense. Read the sentence again - it does not tell you anything unless you already know what it's meant to be saying. If it can be reworded to say something interesting it might be worth keeping.

The vast majority of gamers cannot achieve that payout percentage because they do not play correctly.  It is essential to draw correctly depending on the content of each dealt hand, and there are strategy tables devised by computer which determine how to do so, depending on the payout table. (Hence you need different strategy tables for different payout tables!)  My ambition is to add such strategy tables to the Video Poker article, but I can't just copy-and-paste such strategies from an existing book due to copyright. To get around that problem, I have an off-the-shelf analytical program that allows the creation of strategy tables based on a weighting of difficulty vs. accuracy. These tables are slightly different than the published ones, but still accomplish the desired positive payoff.  If you're interested in getting a good feel for this, there is a training program called ``WinPoker`` available from Zamzow Software, (in the U.S.), that allows you to practice, as well as automatically run through a great number of hands using a given payout table and strategy.

She was killed by an Israeli bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza.   While speaking via a loudspeaker and wearing a red coat, in front of a physician's home which the Israelis intended to bulldoze, Corrie fell down. A bulldozer then ran over her twice. Later, as a group of people gathered, a man was shot and killed by the Israel Defence Forces.   Corrie was a senior at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.``  *A week after she was killed: ``Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.  Corrie grew up in Olympia, Washington, and graduated from Capital High School. She had been a senior at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, where she studied the arts and international relations. She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM). In her home town, she was known in the local peace movement and an active member of the Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace.  Friends describe Corrie as athletically slender with blond hair and thoughtful, intelligent eyes. She played soccer, gardened and loved the poems of Pablo Neruda. She was the daughter of Craig Corrie, an insurance executive, and Cindy Corrie, a school volunteer and flutist.``  *April 2003: ``Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.  *From December, 2003: ``Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American activist who was crushed to death when protesting Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip.  As a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), she traveled to Rafah during the Al-Aqsa Intifada and tried to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Caterpillar D9 bulldozer.

While protesting the Israeli occupation, she was was fatally wounded when she tried to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Caterpillar D9 bulldozer.  Her death sparked controversy, with various advocates scrambling to blame it on the IDF, the ISM, ``Palestinian terror``, and on Corrie herself.  *From October 2004: ``Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 - March 16, 2003 was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who was run over and killed by an Israeli soldier operated bulldozer while she was protesting Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes in Rafah in the Gaza Strip.

Perhaps we should delete the articles, because no regime could ever qualify. That is not what neutrality means. The USSR qualifies under those definitions, under the vast majority of non-Marxist scholarship (we have already dealt with the sources issue at length), as reflected in Britannica and Encarta which both deal with the former USSR at length and very adequately synthesize that scholarship into long articles. Also, earlier versions of this article included the terms and were edited out. I encourage those interested to go back and see what went on previously.   The issue is whether ``totalitarian dictatorships`` are non-neutral language. I don't think they are non-neutral at all.

Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.  I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.  Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.  The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.  So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.  In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.

Vodka is easily the biggest curse ever seen in history, it makes people drink their brains away and halts all progress or human effort.

You could have Written ``Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west``. Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered  Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  ``human-rights situation`` which you hope anyone can interpret as anything.  Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?  revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only ``a situation``. A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.  Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen! Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance?   I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to  disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there must be some divine logic here beyond my rationality. Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then? Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLY that means not ONLY the palestinians!   Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds? if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes  important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as ``Human rights situation``?   and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all the henceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps? remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men. they might cause something to your ``Human rights situation`` otherwise.   And this pargraph:   an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction  do you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!   And this,  ``Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.``  Are you hinting that this sentence: ``While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians``  is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are ther any references of this, or just hearsay?  Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it! (never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?) And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering.

The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance  I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map.

I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 10470096, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 1569, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 663, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 704, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 116, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 63, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 2383, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 2360, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 757, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 841, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 842, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 1303, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 1318, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 1539, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 1567, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 614, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 344, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 447, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 603, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 591, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 548, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 488, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 485, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 2293, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 2203, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 2171, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 475, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 10470096, "2": 317, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.2, "1": 10471642, "2": -1, "3": -0.4}, "2": "  :I am sorry that your edits were removed from the article.

These ``allegations`` of ``fabrications`` have been provable facts of fabrications.  It calls into questions so many other things about the guy.  What other things is he out and out lying about???  But more importantly the way that the section on his fake Indian heritage needs to be completely re-written.  Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years, I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country, who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchill's fake Indian heritage was a ``cheap shot.``  We have been hearing that from non-Indians for many, many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.  He claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters.  That is a damn lie too.  He has been claiming Indian heritage for over 20 years.  It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.  He committed fraud when he applied to the University of Colorado.  The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes.  That is a damned lie.

You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ``real Arab`` from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ``al-Qushayri`` roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).

I suppose it takes some detective work to come up with this, although it isnt really that difficult. I leave it up to you guys to interpret the intentions behind this sequence of events:  ===The old version=== As seen in the version timestamped 07:25, 7 Jan 2005 in this page's edit history, the page listed only countries (as commonly accepted to refer to fully independent entities as recognised by the UN), with an opening line which reads:  ``This is a list of countries that only have a land border with one other country.``  ===Carbon copy created=== On 01:21, 4 Feb 2005, a similarly titled page called List of countries bordering only one country was created by a user named . In the first version of that page, the opening line reads:  ``This is a list of countries and dependent territories having land border with only one country. Notes: This list includes dependent territories and some disputed or occupied areas that are de facto independent.``  Interestingly, that first version includes Hong Kong and Macau as the only two non-independent entities, while Singapore was listed under a classification called ``Arguable``.  ===Merger?=== Within a few hours, the page has evolved to this version at 03:13, 4 Feb 2005. Notably, he copied the introductory text from the first article into his version of the article:  ``Nations that only share a land border with one other country often have concerns about domination by the other state if it is larger. These can be fears of an outright take-over as has happened historically to such states as East Timor, which was part of Indonesia until very recently, and Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom until 1921. Today concerns are often about economic domination as with the Canada/United States relationship or the Denmark/Germany one. Because much trade goes over land these countries are often heavily reliant on their single neighbour.``  In addition, he added the ``merge`` request with the above page within the same edit.  Back in this page, he also added the ``merge`` request at 03:11, 4 Feb 2005  ===Merged=== By 18:57, 7 Feb 2005,  fulfilled the merger request. This effectively places 's introductory paragraph concerning non-independent entities, as well as his entries for these, into that list as can be seen in edit version 19:01, 7 Feb 2005, without  probably suspecting anything unusual.  ===Contestations=== Since this merger, debates over the inclusion of entities which are not countries ensued, unsurprisingly, as we can see above and in the history of edits. It is interesting that  made no mention about the merger process which sparked this discourse. In addition, as we can all see from the above discussions,  was quoted as saying:  ``They aren't sovereign states, but the same treatment should applies to all lists of countries with the same setting. The notice at the top of the page already tells this list includes not only sovereign states, without any confusions.``  It has to be noted, that again he did not mention who was the one who wrote that paragraph, and nor did he mention how it ends up being introduced to this page.  ===Deductions and comments?=== The chain of events as I noted ends here.

The issue of the particular image in question has been closed for the time being, Though curiously it was closed immediately after someone posted a note questioning the claim of its supposed ``free-use`` copyright status, which actually, to my knowledge had not been investigated. It is my understanding that the image is now ``safe`` from further debates about its inclusion for at least a month. I can accept this. I do not in any way accept the idea that the case, or the issues that it raises, are closed, and that myself or anyone should simply ``shut up`` about it.   On another issue that my activity has raised: I do generally deplore notifying people of things to which they have not expressed any indications of wanting to be involved with in any way, and whether for commercial, political,  or general social goals I would indeed consider that ``SPAMMING``. I  would prefer to consider what I have done ``targeted campaigning`` upon an issue, in which a very strong and very clear consensus that had been indicated in no uncertain terms was CERTAINLY being ignored and evaded. Very contrary to some people's  assessments and accusations against me, I had NO intentions of keeping my actions secret, nor disguising them in any way. I actually expected people's reactions to them to further publicize the issue in question, and that is exactly what occurred.   To the minority of those who I contacted who were in any way offended by my attempts to notify them of what was occurring, I can and will apologize, and I ask their pardon. The responses that were generated would indicate that the majority did not feel that way. What I would consider genuine ``spamming``, or at least the most obnoxious extremes of it, is engaged in by people who are well aware that hundreds or thousands of people will be burdened and offended, for every one who might respond positively to their actions, much like the posters of these photographs, which most people DO classify as hardcore pornography, normally limited to ADULTS, including the providers of the images.

Do you think that real nation builders have the stomach for low life crap artists like the Emperor of Atlantium?   doesn't want Fifth World (5W) nations mentioned, and the reason he doesn't is perfectly logical in his praying mantis-like brain: it's the only way his foolish, immoral, and useless nation can compete with the likes of a 5W nation. He doesn't like the 5W not because it is ``incoherent drivel,`` but because it is the very opposite. Read this article to get an education, if you still care about getting one on the subject: TTF-Bucksfan related news.  If his article on the Empire of Atlantium hasn't been voted for deletion yet (Sysops can do that, not me), and I have no evidence that it was, nor that it could possibly survive such scrutiny, then what's my purpose here? It is certainly not to write a better and more comprehensive micronational article!  I have better things to do with my life, and I'll just write my own articles in my User file, where they don't bother nobody seeking publicity from the Wikipedia, and who finds the truth compromising to his success. I'll write my own articles if I feel like it.  can't make and will never make any real history with Atlantium, so he's chosen to do the next best thing: make his nation seem relevant in the Wikipedia, when in reality it isn't even relevant within the micronational community.   == Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics ==  Hi Rick,  I wrote this quickly today following roughly how somebody had started the Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information.

For example, fascism is closely linked to right-wing thinking by only the third sentence! Since fascism is a 'radical' ideology it would be anathema to anyone who regarded themselves as a  'conservative'. (Furthermore, fascism advocates large, intrusive government, and therefore could be considered more akin to  left-, rather than, right-wing philosophy, which advocates the exact opposite.)  Also: ``in theory anyone has an equal chance in a free market. However in practice, a free market is likely [...] to result in [...] almost all of the real ``power`` held by a small percentage of the population. Hence, it can also be considered a doctrine of the right-wing.`` Hence? *Hence*? This seems to imply as /fact/ that a doctrine of the right-wing is that power should be held by a small percentage of the populationwhich is at best, a highly disputable opinion, at worst, a complete nonsense.  :I agree with this criticism.  Economic ideology is better expressed somewhere else.  I've tried to rewrite it with a NPOV.  Let me know your thoughts.   The article now seems to imply that ``right-wing`` is the same as ``conservative``, in the sense of resisting political change.  However I have the impression that right-wing is defined simply by opposition to left-wing doctrines, not opposition to change in general.  The leftist agenda is for government-mandated equality, in the mild version proposing equal rights for everybody under the law, followed by income redistribution through taxation, and in the extreme version progressing to communism.  E.g., if the left propose abolishing a monarchy, then anybody who opposes this is on the right, and is also conservative.  However if someone was to propose establishing a monarchy in a place where none ever existed, this would still be right-wing, but not conservative.  Does this make any sense?     :The concepts of political ``left`` and ``right`` will always be difficult to define precisely, because they are inherently amorphous, but I would say it is unfair to categorize right-wing thinking as merely being in opposition to change from left-wingers.   :Speaking from a right-wing perspective, I would say that right-wing ideology is fundamentally *pragmatic* in naturei.e. right-wingers believe that change should take place in terms of *reform* of existing institutions which evolved over aeons and have successfully stood the test of time. Right-wingers are therefore naturally scornful of Marxist/Revolutionary ``idealists`` who believe in a ``Year Zero``, the discarding of all ``old`` ideas, and starting again from scratch (exemplified by such catastrophic failures Stalin's Five Year Plans, and Mao's Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution). In the case of the Cultural Revolution, 3000 years of Chinese culture was chucked down the pan, by ``enlightened`` left-wing philosophersalthough this is an extreme example, most left-wingers aspire to re-invent society in some such manner, and this will always be opposed not only by those who revere the past, but by those who have any grasp of pragmatism.  :Although Libertarianism refuses to categorize itself as either left- or right-wing, I would say that many modern right-wingers are libertarian in nature, in that they believe in the freedom of the individual from the interference of the state, as opposed to the state-centric paternalistic view of the Left. Low taxation is a fundamental principle of the Right, and low taxation necessarily results in a smaller role for government, and (it is argued) therefore greater individual freedom.  Hmmm its difficult this right-left wing thing, It seems to be something you instinctively ``know`` whether something is left or right wing, but when you come to define it in detail it becomes very difficult.  There seems as far as I can tell, to be two different strands of right-wing politics which often contradict each other. There is a ``conservative`` right which generally opposes change from tradition, generally defends priveliged elites and wealthy interest groups, and opposes egalitarianism and is generally suspicious of rampant capitalism, often prefering protectionism, and favouring small business.  And there is the ``free market`` or ``radical`` right, who are perhaps best exemplified by say Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan who often profess to believe in traditional values etc, but advocate radical free market policies of deregulation, privatisatio", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 16701860, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1275, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1259, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1649, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1113, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 2396, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1806, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 2958, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 44, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 2388, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1929, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1098, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1086, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1083, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 1033, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 917, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 471, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 328, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 192, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 905, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 16701860, "2": 122, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 16754437, "2": -1, "3": 0.05}, "2": "`  :I was there some years ago and they told us this.

Please point it out to me as I would find it interesting to know who included it.     == Please don't delete or edit other people's comments ==  CheeseDreams, please don't delete or edit other people's comments on the Talk pages. You've done it to me personally twice now (that I've noticed), once in the talk page of the Cultural and Historical Jesus, and (at least) once before on the Wikiproject:Jesus discussion page, when you made most of the discussion of Christology in the strikethrough font. You seem to be relatively new to Wikipedia, so I'm asking nicely. Say what you need to say, but let others say what they say and let their words stand on their own. Thank you.   :If you mean a comment in the summary, that is because I summarised the text. Your comments can be viewed at archives 2-5.  :And on Wikiproject:Jesus, I struckthrough (but did not delete) items which had been actioned. This is the standard practice for todo lists is it not?    :: I meant the comment on the summary itself, encouraging people to read those archives instead of relying on someone's summary. On Wikiproject:Jesus, the text you marked as strikethrough were not part of a todo list, it was a discussion of whether to do anything with Christology at all. In both cases it appears that you were trying to delete or conceal my objections to your proposals, rather than actually respond to them. Maybe that wasn't your intention, but it certainly had that appearance.  \\ :::It already says that the full text is in the archive, and that the summary is by me, and disputed by you. :::W.r.t. the wikiproject, if you note the talk page, you will see that I struck through everywhere that there was discussion which I had actioned. If I had intended to delete or conceal your objections, I would merely have deleted the text, or put    tags round it.    :: Also regarding your summary of Slrubenstein's comments, ``yanking someone's chain`` doesn't have anything to do with masturbation in the U.S., at least when used in the context Slrubenstein used it. It just means he wondered if FT2 were saying things just to get a reaction from him. That's probably an honest misunderstanding between the two of you, but it might be helpful if you acknowledged it and corrected that part of your summary. Thanks.     :::If Slrubenstein agrees to retract his uncivility toward FT2 such as ``charicature of a nut``, ``ar eyanking my chain``, ``your reasoning is specious and ignorant``, and apologise for them, then I am perfectly willing to remove the comments from the summary. Until that time, they remain, since this is how I and other non-US (remember that the majority of english speakers are not in the US) readers read the text.  :::I have also just looked the phrase up in a slang dictionary, and cannot find an alternative meaning to the phrase.    :::: I agree, most English speakers are outside the US, so it's a very understandable misunderstanding. Here are links to a couple of definitions that I think are better than the one I gave, and probably closer to what SLR meant: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yank+one's+chain and http://www.ozyvoyuer.com/aussieslangdictionary.html#Y. (The second looks Australian, so it's not a strictly US-centric usage.)     ==Arbitration==  Thanks for pointing me in the direction of the RfA. A lot of familiar names in that crew! I don't know that I'd call them a cabal but I know what you mean. They've learned that the best way to push a POV is to gather a small gang. The way Wikipedia is structured it's easy to subvert consensus by doing so. I'll try to have a look at what's passed and if I can comment constructively, I'll do that.    Regarding arbitration, CheeseDreams, I was not implying at all that I didn't agree that I should recuse myself  I did so, as I hope you noticed.  I was noting that it is Arbitration Committee practice for someone involved peripherally in a dispute (or directly, of course) to recuse themselves, and that in the past no one has needed to prompt arbitrators to do this.  We're intelligent, we're committed to fairness, and we police ourselves pretty effectively in this regard.  I was just wishing you'd have given me the courtesy of waiting to see if I would recuse myself from the case, rather than assuming I wouldn't.  I will note, though, that the standard you suggest is generally considered too high for arbitration here.  In a case like yours, it's obvious that with so many involved parties (in a relatively small community), all of those people will know at least one arbitrator  mere acquaintance does not require an arbitrator to recuse.  We recuse when we're involved in the case itself, or when one of the involved parties is either a long time enemy or close friend.  If arbitrators could only hear cases involving users they had never before encountered, we couldn't arbitrate any case effectively.  Just thought I'd offer my thoughts, and let you take them as you please.  On another note, I am not sure if it was you who wrote the phrase ``cabal of 'fundamentalists'`` in your arbitration request, but if you did, I'd suggest to you that it might be wise not to use that phrase.  The list of users who oppose you includes at least one very dedicated atheist and at least one other person who is openly hostile to Christianity  characterizing the list as ``fundamentalist`` will be seen as a blanket generalization.  Obviously you can do as you please, but I think other users will notice the word and the users, as I did, and be confused or else draw negative assumptions (i.e., characterizing atheists as ``fundamentalists`` might be seen as an indication that one is hasty to judgment, etc.).  Now, I'm sure you don't much like getting a note from me, so I'll disappear, but if you ever do feel like talking, I want you to know that I'd be happy to.  As I hope you can see above, I'm not ``out to get you``.  I'd like to understand you a little better, and I'd like to be able to work with you productively if I can.  If you'd like to talk about it, drop me a .  Thanks,    :Unlike most of the arbitration committee, as far as I am aware, you have actually engaged in debate over controversial issues with me. I regard that as being ``an involved party``.    :No, I wrote the phrase 'cabal of ``fundamentalists``', please note the quotes around the word ``fundamentalist`` :I have absolutely no issue with getting a note from you.   ::I'm glad  here's another note then.  You seem to misunderstand me (perhaps I'm not communicating well).  I have agreed with you on two separate pages already that I most certainly am an involved party.  I don't want to sound at all rude, but I have to admit that your continued responses to me are making me wonder if you understand what I mean when I say that I have ``recused`` myself from the case.  If I am wrong, please forgive my suggestion.  But if you are unclear on what it means, it means that I have openly declared that I am an involved party and that I will not offer any arbitrator opinions (or any votes) on your case, should it be accepted.  I apologize if it is unclear  I had thought that ``recuse`` was common in the English court system as well, but I confess I do not know it well, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  As far as the quotation marks around ``fundamentalist``...well, as I said, it's your choice.

This isn't a list of people who ``kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe`` are transgender.  The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.  The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.  And what are ``transvestite tendencies`` in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.  Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: ``Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.``  What's the association between the two?  Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible.   28 June 2005 21:00 (UTC)`", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 17787508, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 3134, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 645, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 30, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 13, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 864, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 2557, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 326, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 1939, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 525, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 404, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 975, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 1067, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 1094, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 168, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 1103, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 1589, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 67, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 17787508, "2": 1795, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 17826163, "2": -1, "3": 0.1}, "2": "`  Decius despite what those people claim, it's literally more likely to meet a Turk in Norway than a Skopjan in Greek Macedonia.

Once they tried to put up some propaganda posters written in Cyrillic but had their office smashed on the next day, and ``thus was this matter settled``. Macedonian Slavs will claim that some 95% of Greek Macedonia is ethnic Skopjan, opressed by the Greek government and forbidden to speak its language etc, etc, etc. The story about the infamous ``partition`` of Macedonia refers to the defeat of Bulgaria during the Balkan Wars. Of course there's no record of a ``Macedonian`` army ever taking part, although in their history books it can reach up to 100,000 soldiers (that would be 1/6 of the army of Napoleon and slightly smaller that the army that conquered Constantinople under Mehmed II).

That can't really be denied.  :Rather, the word ``wikiclique`` is a schoolyard insult that can only serve to infuriate the very people with whom you are trying to reach consensus.  The issue you're raising on the Village Pump is important, but I feel that your vituperance is diminishing it and alienating others.  If you expect civility, you must be civil yourself.  .  :Clearly   == beta Systemic Bias section == (Regarding gathering support for removing the systemic bias from the Wikipedia)  Hi, if you wish to help contribute to a beta version of a Wikipedia page section designed to counter-act Wikipedia's systematic bias, please sign the bottom of this section on the Village pump - Wikipedia:Village_pump#Systemic_bias_in_Wikipedia. If not, no worries.  :I can't sign yet; I need to know more.  All I gleaned from your conversation is that you feel an emphasis on things less important than the Congo Civil War and the Holocaust constituted a bias.  What other articles do you feel betray this bias?  What, to you, is the set of articles that, when expanded, will counteract aforesaid bias?Alternately, if you don't have a clear idea of what precisely is causing the bias, then why raise such a ruckus about fixing it?  None of us know or can predict what makes you feel that the Wikipedia is biased, and we all have different ideas about what articles need emphasis.  You'll need to help us out and flesh out your idea more.I think the present method (i.e., let people work as they will) is the best solution for the moment.  Eventually, every important topic will get covered, even if the fanboys get to write their novels and video games into the Wikipedia first.  .  ::Your characterisation of my argument doesn't match with what I think. I mention the demographic make-up of Wikipedia, and how this influences the character of Wikipedia. Rather than gleaning, read the arguments carefully. I am not suggesting changing the current methods of editing Wikipedia. My idea is merely a small addendum to the many ways articles are brought to peoples attentions.    == Merging Afghanistan == (Regarding my request to merge List of leaders of Afghanistan with Heads of Government of Afghanistan)  Hi Ardonik -   Thanks for your message.  I didn't want to duel-post a template - and I hope it wasn't too much of a surprise!  As you will see - there has been a lot of discussion/contention about lists of rulers etc. and what suits one person is an anathema to another. So it was ironic that another variation has been thrown into the equation.  I would like to arrive at a uniform format for all these lists - and I think that it is achievable - but may not be to everyone's taste.  This is how I see it:-  Head of State is the 'modern' generic label for a 'ruler' of an independent state.    There are some regions which are not independent states (those located in African countries, for instance) which it would be right to use the term 'rulers' for the leader.  Head of Government is a generic for the primary official in the government of an independent or non-sovereign state.  For clarity I like to try to avoid 'concurrency' on a single page - unless it is unavoidable, the page should comprise a single chronologically consecutive list and the phrase to present should only appear once on the page.  Some lists are quite long already, and I am aware that to combine lists would put some people's backs up.  But then again, to combine some and not others would be inconsistent and would vary how people approach each list.  Anyway,  as I say this is only how I see it.  The concensus should prevail - and if hundreds of people disagree with me (rather than the odd one or two) then sobeit.  I am always open to working in collaboration in the project.   Hope my reasoning makes some modicum of sense.  Thanks again for your message.  Speak soon.    :Although it doesn't sound as formal, perhaps ``List of leaders of X`` could serve the combined role of ``List of X-ish heads of state`` and ``List of X-ish heads of government.``  After all, the world leader is timeless, while the word state meant nothing before the advent of the modern nation-state.  (Just a proposal.  I'm not sure of precedent or what the current convention is leaning towards right now.)  .   ::I'm just concerned that that might sound ambiguous - and someone is bound to jump up and down about a perceived ambiguity!    :::You have a good point.  I meant ``leader-as-in-an-executive-office-holder-or-similar-position,`` not ``leader-as-in-role-model.``  For me, ``Leader of Afghanistan`` pretty clearly refers to the person calling the shots, and not, say, other members of the interim government or to anyone in any leadership role over there.  But I acknowledge the ambiguity.I think we're stuck.  English doesn't have a single clear, unambiguous phrase for the person in charge \u2014 it depends on when and where they're in charge.  If I had to choose between ``heads of state`` and ``heads of government``, I would choose the latter over the former every time, even if that meant listing leaders who, in their days, were not heading what we would now call a government.  .   ==Logos== (Regarding the copyright status and appropriate tag for Media:Wikimedia.png and related images)  It's GFDL but it's also a trademark, so can't be used in the same way as most other GFDL images. The same is true of all our logos other than the MediaWiki one which I think is PD. I was going to point you to m:Logos but I just realized that page is missing all the copyright information as well. I'll try to get it clarified.   :Thanks.  I've replied on your .  .   ==Thanks== Thanks for the birthday greetings (though it's still not till tomorrow here).  Surely that should be at Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by birthday?  )    *Page created.  Feel free to humiliate others by tricking them into revealing their birthdays and then listing them therein.  .   ==Link Spamming== Ardonik - I got your message about link spamming (131.191.72.23), and I'm a bit taken aback.  You've mistaken my information site for a personal blog site, and removed all of the relevant external links I added.  I really am glad that people like you are watching out for the quality of information here, I just think that you were a bit zealous on my part.  I admit that I write my own content, and I'm trying to share it with others; but I contest that the links I added were relevant   *On the State Songs page, after the listing for ``You are my sunshine``, I added a link to my performance of the song (available for free).  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to upload the song ?  Create a page just about the song ?  I'm not sure, but I imagined that readers might want to hear the song. *On the Weblog page, I added a listing of sites where a person could get a blog for free.  I'll admit that my site has free blogs, and was on the list, but is the information not useful ? *And then the Origami page, which I added a link to the book I've been writing with detailed origami instructions.  Why would you delete that, when there are four other sites in the list that I tacked mine on the end of ?  I spend a decent amount of time making sure that if I add anything to Wikipedia, it is useful.  Honestly, I am motivated to integrate my website into the internet, but I try very hard to make sure that i", "4": "user", "5": "random", "1": 18033778, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1238, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 160, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 176, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1362, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 222, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1436, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 420, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 525, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 3807, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 598, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 3048, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1161, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1183, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1466, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 739, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 745, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 250, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1863, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18033778, "2": 1822, "3": 1.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 18072842, "2": -1, "3": 0.2}, "2": "Hmm...I believe that almost all American farmers buy their seed from seed companies.

Walker (BYU Professor of History),  ::::::Richard E. Turley Jr. (managing director of the Family and Church History Department of the Church), and Glen M. Leonard (director of the Church's Museum of Church History and Art).   ::::::The three were granted access to documents in the LDS Church archives. According to Turley, a file in the archives confirms that Lee was acting on his own. The file included the notes of a Mormon historian who, at the request of Church leaders, conducted a confidential investigation of the massacre in 1892. Turley said, ``There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.``  ::::::While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that ``Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . . Unfortunately, the militia and church leaders of Iron County made different decisions, and their acts demand the strongest condemnation . . . Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.``  ::::::The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is ``not a Church commission``; ``The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs.`` Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. ``Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,`` Turley said, adding that the authors will ``present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.``  ::::::The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books.

PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that ``a designer created flagella``, science says ``no further information known``. There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observable, repeatable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a rigorous, scientific point of view. If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient ``to know`` that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like ``legitimate possibility`` or ``probable explanation``. Science is far too patient to give up so quickly in the face of an unknown natural phenomenon.  `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 18597501, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 598, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 127, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 153, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 200, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 285, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 309, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 506, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 481, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 1436, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18597501, "2": 689, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 1.0, "1": 18606380, "2": -1, "3": -2.3}, "2": "  ==  GAY SEX,  ANAL, ALL NIGHT ==  Why are you reverting me?

Don't answer the questions beyond that ::Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.    ::First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.    ::Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with ``probabilities``. If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say ``well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it``. This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.    ::Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, ``B`` is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if ``A`` were a dead body and ``B`` were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, ``A``, and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed ``B``. (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  `", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 18683910, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 3618, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 3568, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 3177, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 215, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 1165, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 775, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 744, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 94, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18683910, "2": 3139, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 18684063, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": "` ::::Thats what the clause ``standard uncontroversial object`` implied.

First of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of  irritation. I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the ``process`` of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims. 1. I sometimes find a ``You have a message waiting`` notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won't be visible to the world  e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn't want posted here? 2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB. Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica  I don't know how you folks access EB, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides ``teaser`` articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441 We have never been EB ``trial`` members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct? 3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use ``dummy`` accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, ``Oh yeah? Well, prove it!```` I have no idea what sort of ``proof`` one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might ``prove it.`` If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her. 4. As for ``my article,`` I was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have. 5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same ``new posting`` info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings. 6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the ``credit`` for our efforts. However, given the recent unpleasant incidents we've encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, I'm sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment. 7. I'll have to check into templates. I suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why using forms can be so dangerous.  `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 18764566, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 804, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 651, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 322, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 274, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 177, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 163, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 109, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18764566, "2": 62, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": "Management [people] changes as a resust of the Lockheed/Martin Merger", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 18766627, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 2745, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 2027, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 1680, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 2715, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 1358, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 3599, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 780, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 703, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 33, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 18766627, "2": 2165, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 18796221, "2": -1, "3": 0.15}, "2": "`  I agree that there should be some indication of Bach's significance stronger than that second sentence, as it is encyclopedic.

You are correct; I should not laugh at Danny Muse, as it is more depressing than funny to see a cult-like mentality in action, especially on the doors, where many of the public can easily be fooled by Danny's type of false reasoning if they are not careful. I was not making a ``personal attack``, I was attcking his false reasoning. All my criticism of his false manipulative arguments, and deliberate attempts at deceit all still stand. Interesting, I see you do not criticise him for calling people ``idiots, and pigs``, why is this Tom? Is there one rule for some and a blind spot for others? Danny needs to realise that if he is to make a case, it has to be rational, not wild negative propaganda, and slippery false reasoning, regardless of his religion training him this way, it is not an excuse for him to use manipulative twisted reasoning here, hoping no one will perceive it. His veiled deceit and lying conclusions to incorrect points he makes all the time should be outed where seen. I apologise if I was rude as I was angry, knowing how many are sucked in by his religion's members specious and often twisted reasoning, but my points all still stand. Regards, Central.

I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is ``a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body`` as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated, hypocrisy, slander and defamation of character, negative grossly subjective propaganda and multiple lies, all of which discredit your character, and your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on the matter, of which you have admitted ZERO knowledge about him, his motives, his life or about his books and their Wikepedia entries, which you have the audacity to claim are ``inaccurate``, and yet you have zero basis for this false claim, but you still cling to it like a rabid Pit bull. Give it up Danny; you are biting at your own air filled fantasies and straw men. Wishing you well, and I hope you come back down to reality soon. Kind regards Central.

Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians.  If someone self-identifies as a train enthusiast that is good enough for me.  If there is a Wikipedia category for train enthusiasts then he should be included.  The category is for ``train enthusiasts`` not ``good train enthusiasts``.  We have no need to examine the purity of his enthusiasm.     Besides, you are on a slippery slope.  In one Western democracy yesterday it was announced that more than 180,000 abortions happened last year.  That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian.  But he never speaks out against abortion.  He also took his country to war on false pretenses (he deliberately told lies) and in that war 20,000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war.  Using your argument Tony Blair cannot be identified as a Christian.     But I do not want to use your argument.  Nor do I think we should.  (But even if we use your argument we cannot see into Tariq Aziz's soul.)  That you (presumably another Christian) re-act with distaste that Aziz belongs to the same club is not the point.  Create a category for ``saintly christians`` is a possibility (although it would be horribly POV) and maybe you should exclude Azis from that category.   `", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 19772948, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 2012, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 1985, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 2104, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 1505, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 1269, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 982, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 115, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 307, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 2281, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 19772948, "2": 834, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 19800824, "2": -1, "3": 0.5}, "2": "43, 28 July 2005 (UTC)  : I see your changes, Wasted, and as they seem to be carefully worded, including the reference to when Rodham began to use the name Rodham Clinton, they form an acceptable compromise.

He added the Logan Darrow to his name a few years ago.  After graduating from University of Rochester's MBA program in the late 80s, he went to the Pacific Northwest and tried a corporate job for about 6 months before departing.  He started a magazine, American Venture Capital Exchange, that had a modest amount of success matching entrepreneurs with investors.  He sold the magazine a few years ago and since then he has been trying to get his TV show, The Lexington League, off the ground.  In my opinion, The Lexington League is basically a free-market, pro-liberty version of 60 Minutes.  Doug will disagree and point out the subtle ways that it is different.  I won't dispute the differences but I do think they are subtle.  He ran for CA governor in the recall election in order to generate publicity for his TV show.  He finished 5th from the bottom.  Fast forward to late June of this year.  I sent an email to approximately 6 of my buddies, including Doug, suggesting that we use eminent domain to take Souter's house from him in order to tear it down and erect a mansion, which would be assessed and taxed at a higher rate.  I later morphed this idea to be a bed and breakfast.  In the email, I specifically referenced getting another of my friends involved because he is one of the country's leading experts on property rights and takings.  Doug sent me an email saying that it was a great idea and I would receive ``100% of the credit`` (not that I want or need the credit).  He created the press release and sent it out and after being interviewed on about 10 radio shows and getting 380,000 hits on his website, he sent me another email acknowledging his indebtedness to me for the idea.  However, he has avoided any public acknowledgement that the idea was anyone's except his own and he has declined to take advantage of my contacts including the aforementioned attorney as well as a friend of a friend who is a real estate developer.  This leads me to believe that he is not serious about the use of eminent domain against Souter and he is really interested in getting people to mail him money and increasing the public's awareness of his TV show.  This is my conclusion.

Since this anon (whoever it is) didn't actually add the entries to CFD, I don't think it's inappropriate for him/her to vote.  And, if his/her ISP dynamically allocates IP addresses and the user want to remain anonymous, how would you expect him/her to vote?  Calling these ``sockpuppet`` votes seems a little overly confrontational.  Would you consider changing your note to be a little less insulting (assuming good faith)?  Perhaps something like ``user assumed to be the same as the user who originally added the cfd tag``?  IMO, accusing someone of being a sockpuppet is assuming some level of malicious intent, which I think is perhaps not warranted in this case.  BTW - in case you have any doubt, I assure you I am not the anon in question.       Hi, thanks for your message.  Actually, I had assumed good faith. I will change the notes on the ones that Kbdank71 ``added`` but the anon tagged.  The only reason I used the term ``sockpuppet``, is because if you actually read his votes, he insinuates that he is not the same person, yet they are all the exact same edits by each IP, along with the post on Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts stating he was not the same person.  I have tried to assume good faith, but he continued to remove Cfd tags, have categories requested to be speedied.  The only way I fealt the discussion could be fair, is if all were aware of the activities of the anon, although I'm sure most people realized it was the same.  Have a look at the log I created, if you haven't already .

But the nature of terrorism is that it relies on people not realising that they will die anyway, with probability 1; and the chances of getting struck by lightning are literally higher than dying from terrorism.

There is no War on Lightning simply because there are more deaths caused by lightning strikes that happen about by natural causes. We are at war with willful guerilla groups and states that sponsor activities to over throw or terrorize stable governments. The difference now then was then is that the Bush administration has called it so a war, and has opted to use the military along with the FBI and the CIA.   The War in Iraq was not about oil. That is speculation. You can try to ``prove`` it with all the shoddy evidence you have that probably points to other things, that you try and twist to fit the picture that it was about oil. The war was about upholding UN Resolutions dealing with Saddam Hussien to account for his weapons of mass destruction. The onus was sqarely on him and he failed to comply. The only thing that terrorism had to do with Iraq was that Saddam had ties to terrorism and could employ the use of terror if he was desperate. The case for the removal of Hussien was being discussed even in the Clinton administration.   This situation is so easy to comprehend. I dont know why is has to be tripped up by global oil crusades and tales of maniacal conservatives that want to rule the Earth through their multi-national corporations. Dont you find it odd that the ones spouting this non sense are the anti-globalization crusaders with neo-Marxist tainted glasses that see profit and global finance as the ills of society?

I have edited the links section to add few Mashichist sites to give a greater range  of Chabad views on the issue of identity of Moshiach and the proccess of redemption. While I realize Wikipedia is not a link list I feel that all those sites should be included. I have also moved the ``Breif history of Chabad Messianism``  to the historical sites section from it's original location in the Chabad Messianic sites section since it's not a Mashichist propaganda, but  the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.

Popularity is a complex factor and there are always going to be a lot of reasons, not just one reason like he's from a different country. It's certainly possible that Singh gets a bit less attention than he might otherwise because he's not American, but recall when David Duval hit #1 in the world, it's not like he got a huge amount of attention for that.

However, I think that mysticism in stories makes them much, well\u2026 better. It also enhances the theme.     How does it do that?    :Scorpionman, what makes you think that a movie should only be spiritual if it references Christianity and not another religion? \u2014     I suppose that depends on your point of view. I'm not relativistic, but when it comes to things like science fiction, there's no need for spiritual stuff.    ::In fact, I was disappointed when I learned that the Jedi use some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically.

But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the ``humans`` to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. \u2014     I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my ``weird comment`` stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view.

This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others. It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-H\u00e9gelianism. YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov. You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of ``mass communication`` and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.   I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.   I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or r\u00e9v\u00e9lation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years. Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.   No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.   Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met? They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.   I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology. I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.   This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called ``a controversial person`` and was much different than its current incarnation.  The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.  The references to ``Oh Paula`` probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.  I'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are - Coulter wanting to ``bring down the president``, no matter the best interests of her client/advisee  - Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed - Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her ``trailer trash``)  Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.

This abnormality or genetic disease is at the heart of the casualties sexual problems and gender identity disorder.  ===Treatment=== Gene splicing is a process of removing abnormal genes, which cause disease and replacing them with normal healthy genes.  This type of gene therapy is currently being used for many diseases, including diabetes.  In future, it is expected that gene therapy will be possible in the womb, thus the parents will be able to decide on their child's sexual preference.  Inevitably, most parents will ask that the malfunctioning gay gene causing homosexuality will be corrected and homosexuality will be eliminated through this process.

We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)  It is precisly the regions of the ``Sindhu River`` between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of ``Kashmir`` and ``Punjab`` the real home of Hinduism and ``indoaryans`` (indoiranians).  So what i mean, is that if we talk about ``gypsy`` people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.  That is why many people feel (i am one) that ``roma`` people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say).   Precisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).  That is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. M  Many gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.  We must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains.   The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.   I believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the ``Indoaryan`` of  orgin worriors of ``iranian origin`` that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.   Gypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani (Persian)Afghani(Pashtu)-Punjabi-Kashmiri-Rajasthani-Harayana-Brhamman cultures of indoeuropean or irani-scythian-greekish influence and language...   Gypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS, the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania, Hungary and Russia; and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in Country,Rock and Roll-Hippie Music, Fox Trot-Jazz; and ofcourse latin american rythms like: Rumba, Salsa, Bolero, Tango, Peruvian Valse, Tondero, Zamacueca, Charchalera, Milonga etc...  It errant living and the suffering of a worrior people that pridley did not accept the imposition of mongolian or muslim invaders; so they fled with their women and similar tribes of indoaryan origin into the western regions; saddly to know they to large and were not given any help they dedicated themselves to music, entertainment (circus-acrobats-scene players) and poets; yet they mained t", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 23526460, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 3261, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 203, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 256, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 481, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 2493, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 3117, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 3185, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 3262, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 3892, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23526460, "2": 3923, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": "  *sigh*. people always forget this. it doesn't matter how much bits a system had, it depends in what year it was released in. the eras are based on the dominant bits the majority of the home consoles used  ", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 23554887, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 1622, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 1368, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 407, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 380, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 1722, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 3287, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 3249, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 1960, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 3197, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 23554887, "2": 3351, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 23645769, "2": -1, "3": 0.3}, "2": "`Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia!

NN. having a poem published does not make you a poet, let alone a notable one. getting a picture on the wall at school does not make you an artist, let alone a notable one. but since the musicianship seems to be whats really at issue, i say Delete until the 2006 album is released, then if (and only if) that album meets the music test recreate. Nateji77    *I would like to point out that WP:MUSIC only has to be met by 1 requirement. So even if you do not view the CDs released on Kidatrium and Mushroomcloud Records as ``Albums``, the fact still remains that they (his band Sin Star) has been on 2 national tours. The remarks you made about the picture on the wall at school is churlish btw, VCU's center for the arts is very reputable for it's art galleries if you read the page on them here at wikipedia you'd know. Those tidibits you took cheap shots at were simply part of the biography, not claims to notability. The Music and the Web Design Company should be the deciding factors, and they DO meet the rules... So please reconsider. By all means message me back if you wish to discuss this.  *Look the point summarized is I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating ``There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)`` If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do ? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)  I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them. Please think it over, I appreciate your time.

I talked with Nicholas Turnbull tonight who disagree with your actions. You are not appointed here and do not have to make decisions above the heads of the members of the arbitration comity, so you will be very kind to step aside and anihilate your previous doing.

Any reasons who would be worth mentioning now? You have just been elected admi and the first thing you do is blocking and banning fox from a site you don't know and that you were not aware of for 24 hours ago. This don't go, you are overstepping wikis rules and previously made decision about this talkpage. You are acting very unbalanced and provocating a chaos who wasn't there before and who in fact wasn't there as far as the 22th of september. Isn't your role to make things work?  Another veru very important thing is that you are walking on my article about a Settlement Proposal, that I do recommend you to read carefully, and that you don't have answer to in your recents edits above, and who therefor have no place what so ever under my article and as a part of it. So moove your articles above, to follow suite of your childrens fights, and leave the growing up doing the right thing. This article above was the one I was writng and in fact inserted in Meru own talk page before you made your intrance here, and before the situation degenerated that much. I did it in an attempt to calm tempers down and create a new tangible goal with better opportunity to solve this dilema than revert war and banishments war. I was stopped at inserting my article by constant editing of article from people fighting, and had each time to perform some changement of my article before saving it, at the end it was too late, you hade arrived, talk like c\u00e9sar, ban a person wihtout valuable and argued explainations, without warning, and taken over the role assignated to Meru by N. Turnbull a few days ago.  By the time I arrived to save my article about burrying the hachet, heads had already rolled, thanks for you. For your knowledge, you did it at midnight, a saturday evening, and this kind of action will have required the presence of more users, and an agreement between those. Your opinion about the presence of Igor or not on his talkpage is none of your business, but the business of the arbitration comity and their decision, not yours. You will have to be more patient and leave to other the right to decide. Know your chain of command, and the wikis appointed chain of event before a ban can take place, specialy a definitiv ban! What about the other guy who begin this reverting phase all together? isn't he guilty as well or is he your personnal friend in the discussion forum? For if this is the case, and if you do have preferences for who is right and who is wrong, so you shouldn't be here and make interventions as well. You have to stay neutral, but your judgement sounds arbitrary to me, to the point that even your collegue Meru didn't understood what and why you were doing this and disagreed. Why are you making troubles, and tell me why the alone person who support your actions, is rjb, the exact person known for insulting peoples very often, reverting all the time, and having started this reverting war completely iognoring previous concensus made about the contain of the biography on this talk page. He was destroying the work of people, to who it had taken several weeks to obtain. You didn't baned him, why? Is he your socket puppet, or are you his? What were you doing 6 hours ago and why did you came here? Did someone warned you? What triggered your hush at coming by, first time, so late? I would very much like to know.  You will please move your dispute and different blowings up on one another on a different place, and will take your bad saturday night mood swing somewhere else than on this talkpage, unless you have a satisfactory explaination for what just did happened. You can't ban Igor when Holger Beck Nielsen is going to make an intervention on this talk page. I hope you know who this person is. i do notice that the 2 persons who made reverting a war, and insisted on it are ybm and rjb who are both in very close contact with each other, and in fact I am quiet sure that rjb is The socket puppet of YBM.

I have no doubt they are true, but the tales, though entertaining at first quickly grow weary if one is not a teenager or an Oprah addict. They are irrelevant, except to prove that Ira did not smell. Women were attracted to him. He did not smell at all when I met him in 1974.  Ira's understanding of ``free energy`` and his reference to Tom Bearden are not to my liking because the physics is wrong. However, his connections to the Yugoslavs in 1977 when Holly was murdered, the Shah of Iran's family and many of his political activities made him many powerful enemies with the motive and opportunity to frame him and to weaken the movement he was spearheading. Ira's account of a UFO close encounter rings true. Note Ira's mention of Michael Murphy, Kit Green and Jacques Vallee.  For ``free energy`` read ``zero point vacuum energy``. Ira is not a physicist and he was fooled by disinformation agent Colonel Tom Bearden whose claims are worthless. At that time I had not yet figured out the physics of what Ira was after. He was my book agent and I was one of his network of ``300`` that corresponds also to http://stardrive.org/cartoon/spectra.html  I would not solve the paranormal physics Russian psychotronics weapons problem of DCI Richard Helms until the mid 1990's, i.e. the necessity of signal nonlocality from ``two way relation`` between pilot BIT wave and IT particle ``hidden variable`` and the consequent replacement of micro-quantum theory with the macro-quantum theory of ``More is different`` emergent systems.  I would not solve the UFO problem until 2001 when the meaning of ``dark energy`` for ``metric engineering warp and wormhole`` dawned on me as through the glass darkly. The glass is getting less opaque.``  A copy of Sarfatti's PhD degree is in open directory http://qedcorp.com/APS/  -SIGNED BY Jack Horner no more sitting in The Corner on Sept 25, 2005 10:20 PM Pacific Coast Time`", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 24053937, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 1310, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 1336, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 2210, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 2647, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 849, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 429, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 2688, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 2804, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 214, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 24053937, "2": 907, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.05263157894736842, "1": 24055027, "2": -1, "3": 0.15789473684210525}, "2": "  :I don't feel this way.

Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster ``it's nonsense``. Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out. Everything Sarfatti has said is the truth and his arguments on the physics have not been refuted. You people not only have no respect for truth, you simply cannot even perceive it because this information is too advanced for all of you - even Chris Hillman who is not a physicist although he is a mathematician of sorts - he admits he is not even interested in quantum theory so he should recuse himself if he were really honest.

I was always told you were the persuasive one because of your cool calm reasoned responses and up until now I had no reason to doubt this and have always accorded you the respect of analyzing your arguments and either agreeing or disagreeing.  But you both shock and surprise me with a personal attack in your very fist sentence. To suggest that I'm some knee-jerk reactionary spoling for a fight with the left wing cabal is to caricature me in a grossly distorted way. I  'm here to remove POV. Period. Now, it is acknowledged by you and others that there are currently a preponderance of liberals in here doing the editing, although no one until you would be willing to admit that there was a left-wing cabal and a sinister one at that!   (Remember, you can't say you were 'just joking' because, as we've learned from the liberal editors of the Ann Coulter piece, unless you SPECIFICALLY say 'I was joking' when you make your statment, it means you're as serious as AIDS- so I thank you for that illuminating revelation. It is duly noted.)  Anyway, it stands to reason that most of the POV I will encounter is going to be coming from the left. Do you dispute that or do you think this Karl Rove article is filled with right wing hyperbole?  As for your arguement - ``we have to interrupt his biography to go off on a side excursion, an article-within-an-article that discusses the subject he addressed...`` I can only say McCain...Black Baby Rumor...see above. lol!   I find it hard to believe you can make that arguement with a straight stroke. It is PRECISELY that tit for tat meandering that is the HALLMARK of Ann Coulter and Karl Rove articles. I wish you'd use your persuasive powers to address the McCain push poll incident and Ann Coulters alleged love for terrorists instead of cherry-picking it in a realm where Rove might actually be vindicated.  So, I reject your argumentation for now. In fact, I've understood that Move-On's petition may have been specifically what Rove was referring to. Therefore to omit this information would be a deliberate attempt to leave that quote hanging out there and thus tantamount to POV by default.  And I think one 911 family group comments deserves another. Or, if you like, we can just use the conservative 911 family group's statements. Since we  don't want to make this article 'book-length' do we?   Here's my bottom line: What's good for the goose is good for the gander. And what I've seen here since day one is one form of argumentation used to defend an article if it's good for the goose (democrat/liberal) and that EXACT SAME ARGUMENTATION trashed if it looks good for the gander (republican/conservative.) I hope you don't think I'm the only one who sees this. (Oh btw, when I make post these trenchant observations, I'm used to getting rebuked for 'getting away from content' or 'talking politics.' Funny, how your comments of the exact same nature never get that same rebuke.  Must be 'cabal club' privileges, huh? ) Take care Big Daddy. Ps I do like your style though.  I appreciate the sober analysis that generally exudes from your posts.

This, like is illustrated on the map, ranges throughout Eastern Canada and North East USA. The reason many sources will say it is the Eastern timber wolf I believe is mainly to help conservation. Not only does the name seem more attractive to residents (therefore they are more likely to want to preserve it) but this wolf is comparitively vulnerable in it's smaller range. Another confusion may be because Eastern timber wolves used to live in this area, but were killed off due to the bounties. It was then the other subspecies, the Plains wolf, which eventually reinhabited the North Eastern states. When I have more time I will try to finda reliable source forthis.

I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.  2) This is new. It's from Conason: ``Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments.`` Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.  3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: `` She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as ``harmless American citizens`` [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.`` Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent.   This quote is also troubling: ``Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing.`` Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this: ``Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.``  Whady'a say?  (Much more on this section later.)  4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.  5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are ``not as bright`` as men'? Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

I don't think his intention is to comply with them. If no one expresses dissatisfaction and advocates change, there would be no improvement.  On the other hand there are users who are abusing the system covertly, like user Zoe and user Mikkalai. User Zoe is using Wikipedia to torture people by artificially finding fault in people's contributions. If she is not sufering from Sadistic Personality Disorder, why doesn't she make contributions herself? What's there in it for her?   User Mikkalai's point of view is not neutral. User Mikkalai from Belarussia (an area notorious for right wing tendencies) who is behind the current edition of the Intelligentsia article seems to have a political has reconstructionist, zarist, and nationalistic bias and his edits distort the truth through omission, taking things out of context, and other tools of propoganda. For some reason he stops on pre-revolution Russia, as if there was no further developments after that? Is that neutral?    The important role intelligentsia played during the Soviet epoch (70 years of history) is understated if not absent from the article. There is no explanation of the role Jewish intelligents played in the revolution, and why many Jewish intelligents joined the revolution (pogroms and cherta osedlosti) is not mentioned. He is quoting Lenin as calling Intelligents ``the shit of the nation``, while he does not mention that Lenin and Trotsky were intelligents themselves.   The attribute of a cosmopolitan is not mentioned either, obviously because it is associated with Jews.   He listed for deletion about Abram Kamensky, under the pretext of not being notable enough to be in Wikipedia. Abram Kamensky was mentioned in Russian Jewish Encyclopedia, which is a printed encyclopedia compiled by international experts. How is it that this person is not notable enough to be mentioned in an online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone?  This person was mentioned in a Solzhenitsin's novel, he was a deputy minister of the ministry of national affairs, one of the first people to join the bolshevik party, as mentioned in the debate involved in the founding of the short-lived Donetsko-Krivorogian Soviet Republic,  father of a well-known russian art critic. This is enough to make him notable. The reason he was demoted to a lower post was because he was briefly a member of the Trostkyst opposition, which Stalin didn't forgive him for. At any rate, the argument that he was somewhat obscure by the time of his death does not hold water, because many people who were famous died in obscurity.  The point is, user Mikkalai from Belorussia does not possess a thorough enough knowledge of Soviet history to make that judgement. The reason he listed the article for deletion was personal and political bias.   I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was so people could add research and facts to someone's start-up. Not to list every start-up that is perhaps not well researched enough for deletion.  User Mikkalai even listed Aleksander Kamensky article for deletion for reason of non-notability  one of the most well known art crtitics in later twentieth century Russia, and an internationally recognized expert on Marc Chagall, whose book Marc Chagall, The Russian Years was an international best-seller, and was postthamously reprinted and presented at the Tretiakov gallery with Marc Chagall's granddaughters in attendance. What do you think, this guy knows what he is talking about?  He has vandalized Aleksander Kamensky article. He took out Kamensky's definition of the stern style that was one of the three quotes from one of his books, translated personally by LevKamensky for the article. While in the articles discussion page he requested stern style to be defined. This shows that he deleted it without even reading it. If that is not vandalism, than what is? This is a wolf in sheeps clothing. I suggest reverting the article to LevKamensky's last edition and blocking it from further editing.  Wikipidia articles are always on the first page when you make a search on Google, or another search engine. This makes Wikipidia a very influential tool in swaying public opinion. Many people complain that Americans are dumb, and they don\u2019t know basic facts, or that they are shallow. Well now with the internet, they are becoming more aware, but don\u2019t leave them in the hands of half-illiterate graduate students, or right wing fanatics.  Why was the Russian Intelligentsia category deleted, that LevKamensky created, that contained some three dozen brightest minds in Russian culture of the XX century? Why does the Russian social groups category contain cosacs and peasants but not intellectuals? We think this is more political than neutral.   So stop using Wikipedia as a political soapbox. At least LevKamensky is open about his opinions, he is not manipulative like these charachters.`", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 25405629, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 1256, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 2497, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 3310, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 3529, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 3543, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 909, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 3981, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 3994, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 25405629, "2": 3574, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 25419993, "2": -1, "3": 0.15}, "2": "  ==User Alkiviadis== I uploaded a wrong logo and replaced by mistake the logo of BNP Paribas.

Other biblical accounts imply effects from the Ark correspond with exposure to high power electromagnetic fields, and the 1981 film \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark\u2019 popularise this artefact.`` In short, adds nothing to the Tesla source, and pulls in a rollicking action romp by George Lucas that has nothing to do with it. *  Sassoon, George,  ``The ancient of days: deity or manna-machine?``. *: Broken, but Wayback knows it: .

No. If it could, I could just as well follow it up with theories about how an Ark using electrical discharges would have been very impractical for killing vermin or burning wood, compared to, say, a torch, but all that is beside the point.

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.  Slim is not a ``he``. Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?  She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.  Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.  Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.  So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.  This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.  The BUAV is not a ``controversial organisation``. It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become ``controversial`` just because you don't share it.  Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints -   But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.  thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.  I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.  As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.  First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.  Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.  Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.  Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.  I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.  If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.  I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a ``copyviolater`` trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know it's hard. I find the establishment hard to deal with sometimes. They tend to say ``Wikipedia thinks this...`` when they mean ``My friends think this...`` They forget the diversity and multiplicity of opinion that exists here and live in an echo chamber because they know they are empowered and do not need to pay any attention to that diversity to get what they want.  fyi, 70% of her images are tagged as fair use without providing a single rationale (few of them fall under the subcategories like stamp, logo etc. where it's easy to understand).  Yes. But as I noted, plain common sense would direct you to understand that fair use is being made of the photos. They are the product of a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to educate people about animal torture. Having their material illustrate an encyclopaedia article about animal torture would clearly suit their purpose, as Slim pointed out to you, I believe. Ignoring that makes your approach seem malicious. I think Slim is in part bewildered by your making such a huge, urgent issue out of it, when the chances of legal dispute are so very small. So perhaps we could agree that Slim should provide rationales in due course, and preferably have the photos released under a suitable licence, but in the meantime there's no particular urgency to re-tag them or to insist on rapid action? Surely a commitment to act would be sufficient.  She also keeps reverting to her tags, violating all admin rules.   That's another issue. I think Slim is one of many admins who would be better off not having the powers, because they lead her into disputes of this nature, where the issue all too rapidly becomes her and not her edits, which is unfortunate.  As it stands I'm erring on the side of caution, while Slim wants to stretch the boundry of ``fair use``. Tx 4 ur interest in this.    ''I agree that you're being very cautious, and I think caution is right, as I noted. However, I think in the case of the BUAV images in particular that they are clearly ``fairly used``. You have to ignore their provenance to think otherwise. I can see from your discussion with her that Slim was not very successful in communicating her point of view, because she interpreted legitimate concern over copyright for a personal attack, largely because, I think, you didn't take into account the source of the photos and their likely reaction to their being in WP. Still, I do agree that she should ask for confirmation from BUAV that they are cool with our using the photos; but I think you should lay off them (and her) so long as she has made the commitment to acquire that confirmation.

Threatens to back out of mediation whenever things are turning against his way. In the past, he's tried to game the system by quoting the NPOV policy but then leaving out important points. Again, none of these are personal attacks. It's in the record. To say it's difficult to make heads or tails of his intentions is an understatement.  Ben, I kind of wish you'd just be consistent here.

The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.  This also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the ``Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck``. I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.  However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be ``suburban``, part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.  This article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.  The inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.  I have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages. If there is no further discussion or objection, I will edit the Northern Neck page to include mention of the local debate on the status of King George County.  `", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 27116757, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 2847, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 57, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 333, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 214, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 1892, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 2810, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 1174, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 895, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 488, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27116757, "2": 1124, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": "This should be obvious as one does not file an article RFC against a user.   :", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 27122686, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 125, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 329, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 626, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 797, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 1336, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 749, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 841, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 1373, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 1036, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 27122686, "2": 381, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.5, "1": 27134087, "2": -1, "3": -1.1}, "2": "  == re:Edit warring ==  First off i am well aware of policy, buat as is the case with you self any most admins, you fail to to eith have done your reasearch fully or to find out exactly what is going on, but instead have decided to inject the defacto and unwritten policy of appeasment, which for an encyclopedia is unacceptable.

It seems obvious to me that you selectively endorse the revisions to the Manual of Style or the WP:Albums style guide (e.g. bolding article titles in artists' chronologies), as your reverts  to various article edits go against the current WikiProject Albums style and the MoS guidelines in terms of undoing En dashes, mm:ss album lengths, and proper track listing style, as well as propogating piping years to ``XXXX in music``, low added-value links to years and dates as well as duplicate Wikilinks in articles and templates for years, dates, bandnames, release titles, etc.. I'm being BOLD and editing the Song infobox template soon to be more like the Album infobox, as it should be. You should be reasonable enough to understand that the WP:Album standard is meant to be consistantly applied to WP:Songs, regardless of whether anyone has actually updated the Songs infobox template in due course. It's improper that you feel it necessary to revert completely legitimate edits (generally without properly stating the reasons for revert no less) because you feel territorial about various Coldplay articles, which is against guidelines when people are making edits that are both in good faith, and legitimate alongside the style guides. While I don't take it personally, don't intend on getting into an edit war and I'm sure you can rebutt for yourself, I will be stating these issues in the Songs & Albums projects Talk pages in order to clarify that your reverts are misguided and impeding these projects.

I can't guarantee ALL BX boards support coppermine-Ts, but there's no question at least the Abit BX-133 RAID does, so it's not accurate to say they are old-core-new-board only as is the impression in the current state.  Their last released BIOS notes explicitly list support for 1GHz Celerons which are definitely Coppermine-Ts:   http://www.abit.com.tw/page/sa/download/download_bios_detail.php?pFILE_TYPE=Bios&pMAIN;_TYPE=Motherboard&pTITLE;_ON_SCREEN=BX133-RAID&pSOCKET;_TYPE=Socket%20370   Also, on this forum there's an excerpt from someone who's had communication from Abit re: coppermine-T support (you have to scroll down, no direct link):   http://www.abxzone.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-6817.html  i'm pasting it here:  I think the PIII 1200mhz you guys are seeing is not a Tualatin but a faster PIII called the CopperMine-T.  Check this thread at anandtech:  Link (http://forums.anandtech.com/messageview.cfm?catid=28&threadid;=512647)   There is a post from RichieZZZZ there and he posted:   you need to read HOCP they e-mailed abit about it.  << There is and has been confusion about what exactly Tualatin CPUs will work in as we stated earlier. It seems as if Tualatin CPUs are not backwards compatible with BX or i815 chipsets. When I posted this earlier I got this mail from Don Goff that pointed us to this link which we had posted a month or so ago that states this, ``Supports Intel Coppermine T CPU.`` about their BIOS upgrade for the ABIT BX133 RAID board. Admittedly I am a bit confused about this too so we asked ABIT what exactly the deal is and here is their response.   Kyle,  OK, I have it. It is the confusion about CopperMine CPU vs. CopperMine-T CPU vs. Tualatin CPU.  The CopperMine-T was the CPU that was the bridge between the CopperMine and Tualatin platforms. The CopperMine-T can work in BX boards, usually through a BIOS update.   The Tualatin CPU has a different pinout and simply will not work in a BX board. I have confirmed this with our R&D; and FAE so have to believe that this time it is true.

The USA\u2019s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html  3. The Pledge\u2019s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  The Pledge is part of the USA\u2019s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.  As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.  Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.  Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their ``Nationalist`` and ``New Nation`` magazines, the ``Nationalist Educational Association`` and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book ``Looking Backward`` was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.  In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.    After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.  Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the ``Nationalist`` magazine, and he preached what he called ``military socialism.``  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.  The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the ``Wholecaust`` (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  It was so bad that Holocaust Museums could quadruple in size with Wholecaust Museums to document the entire slaughter.  Some schools in the USA are still named after Francis Bellamy.  The Bellamy schools should be re-named because they send the wrong message to children and the community.  It causes emotional distress to children who attend schools named after a man who popularized the Nazi salute and who helped the government institutionalize racism and segregation.  I, and my supporters, will also assist in any legal means to defray the cost of re-naming Bellamy schools.  If government's schools (and the media) told the true history of the Pledge, then no student would chant it. If Americans knew the truth, then the Pledge would cease to exist.  Fight the flag hags and their flag fetish. Government's schools should not teach kids to verbally fellate flags each morning. It is like a brainwashed cult of the omnipotent state. For adults it is childish. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.  Listen to audio exposing the flag and the Pledge http://rexcurry.net/rexcurry4.mp3                *********************  As an attorney, I am asked if students can be forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance in government schools.  Another school year has started, and it is important to educate children about their right to refuse.  Government schools deserve a failing grade for not teaching students about their right to refuse and about the horrid history of the Pledge. There are still some oddball states where government schools are required by law to begin each day with a robotic chant of the Pledge, after students hear the ringing of a bell, like Pavlov's lapdogs of the state.  Government schools in the U.S. were the origin of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis) because the Pledge's original salute was a straight-armed salute.   It is a myth that the salute is an old Roman salute. Most students never see the eye-popping historic photographs. http://www.rexcurry.net/pledge2.html  I became involved in litigation about the Pledge of Allegiance before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Wonschik v. United States  http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/03-10249.htm  Research in that case and other litigation involving the Pledge, led to astounding discoveries concerning the Pledge's past.  The history of the Pledge is suppressed because it is unlibertarian.  The Pledge was written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, a self-proclaimed National Socialist, who wanted a government takeover of education to produce an ``industrial army`` (a Bellamy term) for the authoritarian vision in his cousin Edward Bellamy's book ``Looking Backward.`` The Bellamy cousins promoted national socialism worldwide for decades. It resulted in racist and segregated government schools that lasted through WWII into the 1960's, setting a horrid example for hate-spewing groups worldwide.   A webpage helps students learn that the Pledge was written by a National Socialist and the rest of the Pledge's truly terrifying history: http://www.rexcurry.net/stopthepledge.html  The eye-popping new version of the popular graphic art ``All in favor of gun control raise your right hand`` is at http://www.rexcurry.net/pledgewonschik.html In the new version, the original Nazi-style salute to the U.S. flag is exposed with the phrase: ``All in favor of a Pledge of Allegiance raise your right hand.`` The graphic art shows the original Pledge of Allegiance on the left and on the right it shows the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. It explains that the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag is the origin of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  In the 1930s, the National Socialist German Workers' Party passed laws that required everyone to pledge allegiance, similar to many state laws in the U.S. that have tried to require school-children to recite the Pledge. Jehovah's Witnesses believed that people who enjoy reciting government pledges are people who worship government. Jehovah's Witnesses were officially banned in Germany for refusing to join the raised palm salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party in schools and at public events. Many of the German Witnesses were imprisoned in concentration camps.  The National Socialist German Workers' Party had adopted the U.S. salute and forced people to perform it.

First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 29693632, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 671, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 735, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 2512, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 1437, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 1642, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 1747, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 1852, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 1926, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 1934, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 29693632, "2": 2099, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 29758490, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": " That helps!

My intentions of contributing to the Whitman article was due to my involvement with the officer who killed Whitman and numerous victims, professors, witnesses and news media outlets. But Alas, I find myself, as Gulliver, lost among a few Yahoos whose intentions appear to be to their own speculation and interpretation of Charles Whitman and The University of Texas Tower Tragedy. Their abuse of sources shows their willingness to subscribe to editing and rules, in the face of facts and researched knowledge. They are pedantic and callous, and I unfortunately have joined them at their own level; I must now re-elevate myself and return to the dictates of logic and critical thinking, something that my experience on Wikipedia has deluted. I will return to my original research and take the experience of Wikipedia as a lesson; that no matter how much experience and involvement a person has on a particular subject, there are always those who no nothing, willing to reduce your efforts to elevate their own egos and ambitions. I will take away all my contributions. I realize they will be re-inserted for the Yahoos benefit, but that will be out of my hands! I would wish you good luck, however, you are going to need something much more powerful than luck to ever make this article correct!

Cannibalisation is most commonly a concern where a company is selling the same products though different channels or in different locations. An example of the former would be a retailer\u2019s web site competing with its shops. Cannibalization reduces sales growth (as the benefits of growth in one place will be offset by a reduction elsewhere). It may also reduce margins if customers switch to a lower cost (for them) and lower margin (for the seller) sales channel. Conversely, obviously, cannibalisation may encourage a switch to a higher margin channel (e.g. internet sales may cut out a middle man) or it may be a price worth paying to develop a new business. Finally although cannibalization is a concern, it is worth remembering that most company\u2019s are already in a competitive environment as they compete with others, so the extra impact of also competing with themselves is often limited. It may even be turned to an advantage, which is why some companies (e.g. car manufacturers, food producers) often sell very similar products with different brand names.", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 30685993, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 1028, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 3364, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 1118, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 66, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 154, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 1664, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 169, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 305, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 1099, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 1648, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 345, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 513, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 520, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 562, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 568, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 570, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 633, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 951, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 443, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30685993, "2": 1663, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.1, "1": 30713019, "2": -1, "3": -0.1}, "2": "  ==Fabrication of posts and unauthorized signatures of other users==  1) You have reverted posts legitimately deleted by the respective authors that include signature tags you have inauthoritatively reproduced while those may no-longer represent her/his perspective or have been done so in order to correct errors.   2)Also my posts that you have alleged to be racist/libellous that were deleted at my whim, yet have been restored by *you* twice in context with the same allegation(s).

In this case the Wikipedia:Controversial_blocks page.  The copy below has emphasis provided where the admins in this situation are failing:   Wikipedia:Controversial blocks From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  While blocking IP addresses responsible for anonymous, clear-cut vandalism is routine, many other uses of IP and username blocks are contentious. Where consensus proves elusive, such blocks are damaging to the community.  The most controversial blocks are blocks of:  * suspected ``sock puppets`` or ``reincarnations`` of banned users * logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions,' regardless of the reasoning for the block * blocks made under the disruption provision of the blocking policy. * blocks that, while possibly wise, lack policy basis.  Once you are convinced that a block is warranted, the recommended procedure for | controversial blocks is:  # Check the facts with care. # Reread' appropriate parts of Wikipedia:Blocking policy. # If possible, contact other administrators informally to be sure there are others who agree with your reasoning. The administrators' noticeboard, IRC and email are effective tools for this. # Place the block, exercising due care in the wording of the ``reason``  message, and include a link to the user page of the user being blocked. # Place a notice of the block on the talk page of the affected user, with additional rationale, outlining the facts and the part of the blocking policy you feel applies. # Be willing to discuss the block with other Wikipedians. Such discussion usually takes place either on the blocked user's talk page, or the administrators' noticeboard (the latter especially in those cases where it was already raised there).  Block wars, in which a user is repeatedly blocked and unblocked, are extremely harmful. They are a source of frustration and disappointment to many seasoned Wikipedians and tend to encourage further bad behavior on the part of the blocked user. Avoid them. Instead, discuss the matter, and try to reach a consensus.  If no consensus has emerged after several respected Wikipedians have reviewed the matter, the user should be left unblocked. `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 30854280, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 1.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 314, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 697, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 722, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 1510, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 1532, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 2027, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 2251, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 2412, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 1627, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 30854280, "2": 2750, "3": -3.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 30863792, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": "  Thanks heah. This is helpful.  Something to consider, is that the references you pointed to \u2013 which are part of a larger list  are very old and are based on work done in the early years of AIDS; also, that subsequent research has not supported the same results.  The primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to AIDS, or more specifically to Kaposi\u2019s sarcaoma, is that they are very weak in terms of data presented.  The results have not been repeated by other scientists.  In fact, within the list of referenced studies, there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers.  The general consensus in the research community, and in the HIV/AIDS community, is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIV/AIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye, they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposi\u2019s sarcaoma (KS).

I just saw tonight's news article on Wikipedia that played on FOX News.  (Earlier, I'd posted here the AP article on Wikipedia from Dec 12, 2005.)  In what has become a huge coincidence, the very day the media begins reporting on the dangers of Wikipedia, happens to be the day immediately after the very week I discovered misinformation and falsehoods being posted on this page about nitrites, and then tried to edit them by attempting to add more accurate information, but then was attacked and harassed by another person who disagrees with my edits  and was ultimately blocked and threatened by a purported Wikipedia administrator.  As was reported in the news today, people can go to http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/ to learn more about how Wikipedia functions, and where the dangers exist.  The folks at wikipediawatch report that, what's happening in Wikipedia, is that any collection of citations that may APPEAR balanced is all that anybody expects. If the title or snippet in a link itself contributes to this impression, then the full text is not researched by anyone.  This is exactly what has been going on in this nitrite page.  As a result, it truly is, as wikipediawatch reminds us, ``garbage in, garbage out, garbage back in...``  and after a few cycles of this, it all turns into `` a big, stinking heap``.  Truly, as the news media warned today: ``Don't believe eveyrthing you read on the Web, especially on Wikipedia!``  The following two posts, found in a wikipediareview blog, sum up my experiences this past week, after having been harassed, threatened and finally blocked, after I attempted to add to the body of knowledge about nitrites/poppers.  They demonstrate how dangerous Wikipedia  based on its current model  really is:  ``Wikipedia's procedural faults, complete anarchy as regards contributions, and sometimes-bizzare social rules do not teach people to become good researchers or writers... it teaches them how to be good Wikipedians, or to get the hell out.`` - Jason Scott ``. . . when it comes to history and politics, Wikipedia can claim whatever it wants by shutting out those who actually know something about a certain topic. In that way, Wikipedia can rewrite history as it sees fit - which may have nothing to do with reality or the actual facts.`` - SummerFR  Finally, this post on a board, discussing wikipedia, really sets it out well:  ``Any moron can pretty well say anything they want on any topic, which is fine for a News Group or a Forum but not an Encyclopedia.  In my opinion a reference source should be authoritative enough to end arguments not start them.  I believe that Wikipedia could better serve the internet community if they checked their facts first before publishing the article.  Instead, we have a situation where the cart is placed before the horse and we end up with what is left by the horse.``   Nuf said.`", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 31129815, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 538, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 776, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 779, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 3057, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 3951, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 3952, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 3558, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 3591, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 3875, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 31129815, "2": 939, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.1, "1": 31167414, "2": -1, "3": 0.4}, "2": "`, 13 December 2005 (UTC) ::::Viriditas, I know your position about my page.

The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans.

Personal Attacks: I called  ``ignorant.`` In the atmosphere I've developed in, that's not anything close to an attack. I do apologize if anyone took offense to it, as they seem to have. I came out of the exchange feeling attacked as well. We seem to have had a cultural misunderstanding. I'll refrain from the practice of using that word as such in this environment (on Wikipedia). This is the only personal attack I remember anyone bringing to me. If you have others, please tell me. Otherwise, please stop saying that I am attacking anyone. It was an isolated incident, and we both seem to have gotten over it. Why can't you? Stop bringing it up.   During the time I was gone, a bunch of anonymous users seem to have popped up here.

Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries ``enforce`` these requirements?  2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these ``passing`` grades?  Your ``grades`` indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?  3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?  4) Most importantly, since the term ``required`` calls for a resource by which adherence to this ``requirement`` can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through ``blind trust``) to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.  In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip ``grades`` of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?     Example:   NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA. To view OFA's hip information on NSBR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org``       AND ISSR -  Hip registration is through OFA and Penn-Hip. To view OFA's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org. To view Penn-Hip's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.zzzzz.org  ``       AND TSSR - Hip registration is conducted through XXXX, however individual results are provided to prospective and current puppy owners by submitting a Request for Health Results Form, available at www.TSSR.com/Request for Health info.   4)If verification of these requirements for the registries is not published nor can be obtained in writing, would you also please indicate this policy.  If you can only provide resource information for a registry you are affiliated with, I would then ask that other discussion participants (i.e. registry members or non-affiliated breeders) provide this information and their policies in answer to my requests above.  Thank you very kindly.

The French report includes several religions and organizations that are also English (American) organizations  yet in the Wiki articles about them, they are not referred to as ``cults,`` nor is the French report cited in relation to them.    For example, the following organizations and religions are included in the French report: Mormons, Jehovah's Witness (reference to the term in the title of a source cited here, but it is not stated in the text of the article as it has been in this one) Seventh Day Adventists (``cultic`` as defined by the author of a cited book on the subject, and it has its own specific meaning - see article on Cults), the Church of God, Transcendental Meditation, the Humanist Party movement, the Church of Christ, Scientist, Pentacostals, and Raja Yoga.  If we are striving for NPOV, then the term ought to be applied equally and objectively to all entries that are also cited in this same report, OR, the report and reference outght NOT to be cited or used in this particular article, OR a different citation ought to be used in which the definition of the term is stated clearly, and/or make it clear that the French article is speaking of the SGI France specifically, (in which case, it would probably only be fair to also find similar reports about each and every SGI organization and see how each country views the organization in its country. And that would be ridiculous.   Otherwise, the only remaining reason for its inclusion in this article and not in others, is because some editors hold a POV about SGI, (as noted in Wiki's article on the subject). That is not appropriate, and NPOV. - Ruby     :Hi Ruby. I thought we'd lost you there!  :I think the cult reference is touchy. And for the record: personally, I think it should be noted in articles on other religious groups when they have been plausibly accused of cult-like activities. Also, everyone might want to note that the French government's usage of ``cult`` is clearly and finely defined: a group has to meet certain objective criteria to be listed.  :As for our article here, please remember that it is not saying that SGI is a cult, it's saying that SGI has been accused of being a cult. That the French government listed it as such is an undeniable fact, and it's something that people looking up SGI should know. I believe that the French government has rescinded this listing, which is something you might want to look into; but nonetheless, credible media in several countries and localities\u2014in the US, particularly southern California\u2014have also described SGI as a cult or being ``cult-like`` (e.g., Die Zeit'', one of Germany's leading newspapers). Almost every website on cults  (even when it's not run by some disgruntled SGI member) also has a section on Soka Gakkai or SGI, so denying or trying to avoid mention of the cult accusations is, I would think, likely to work against SGI: it looks like cover-up, and perfectly reasonable people are likely to interpret that as evidence that the cult characterizations are accurate.  :Besides, if we remove all reference to the cult accusations, Carl7 will just come back and re-insert them again!    ::No way! I am still here. Just trying to reclaim my nights for sleeping!! I haven't really seen anything warranting comment, either, so, I'm pretty well rested, lately! -)   ::I hear you, though, and I also tend towards using a common standard for all articles. And, I agree that it is something that will keep coming back, realistically speaking. But, I feel it is necessary to put the feet to the fire - if it is going to be stated, it shouldn't go unchallenged. And if Carl7 wants to keep putting it in there, that's fine  but let him find real authoritative sources to support his claim, and cite  them.

Why??  It's just a money game!  If they can print off a paper that says the pup is a Shiloh, they get more money for that pup!``  Ms. Barber said: ``Well, to start with, there are ``recognized`` registries, like the AKC, CKC, UKC, SV, UK and various other breed club registries recognized under the FCI.``  Ms. Barber said: ``Then there are the 'self' proclaimed ``registries`` that will issue a piece of paper to anyone that sends them some cash!  They are a BIG joke in the ``official`` dog world, and there is a lot of Internet verification regarding all of them!!``  Ms. Barber said: ``I am sure that the TSSR, NSBR, SSBA, etc. have convinced themselves that they *are* registries, but I can also assure you that no other legitimate organization, like the UKC .. AKC .. FCI .. etc. would agree with them!! Just because someone says something (and it's not illegal) that does not *make* it so!!``   Jareth: (see above) Ms. Barber has repeatedly and continuously made personal attacks about other registries and should be banned by you for doing so.  She should be subject to the same rules/restrictions to which the other contributors to this discussion have been held. Wiki has not allowed others to address Ms. Barber's questionable registry/club/breeding practices, so why is she being allowed to continue to do so?   And, despite being the ``first`` registry, what independent, unbiased documentation has the ISSR provided to show that they are any ``different`` or more ``recognized`` than any other Shiloh registry, when it comes to accreditation by any outside organization. The fact of the matter is, the ISSR is no more ``recognized`` independently than any of the other Shiloh registries currently in operation.  Also, like the 'self' proclaimed registries Ms. Barber references, the ISSR also issues its own ``pieces of paper`` based on Ms. Barber's own determination and her registry charge for these ``pieces of paper``.  What Ms. Barber is claiming about other registries (``Just because someone says something [and it's not illegal] that does not *make* it so!!``), is true of her own, as she has repeatedly throughout this discussion failed to provide unbiased, independent (as you stipulated as a rule for the inclusion of information or contribution) corroboration that her organization is any different.  In addition, the article, as now changed again, with Ms. Barber's numerous links to her own registry's/club's website are again both self-promoting and an attempt to steer readers to her business and to hinder Wikipedia's policy of ``neutrality`` in its articles.  These links are not unbiased, factual, neutral information.  Readers wishing to pursue more information re: her club/registry have the link at the bottom of the article (along with the other registry/club links) they can access if they want to hear more from her.  At this stage, I think it is obvious that Ms. Barber has no intention of negotiating and compromising, in good faith and mutual respect, a ``neutral``, factual, independent, unbiased article. I commend you for your patience and efforts, thank you for your assistance and recommend this process move forward to the next step of arbitration.

My purpose here today is to expose it. In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.  ==Systems of punishment== On , we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced ``time out.`` In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on  saying, ``Good call.`` Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.  We can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.  When we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.  ===Prescription=== Language requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and ``misuse`` would soon render that language ineffectual.  Within the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

If you are unsure of the meaning of something, follow the link associated with it, and read the article about it. If a link is not provided, a good dictionary site such as this one should help.

In relevance to metal genre pages, and metal bands in genre. There is often discussion upon things to do with these, but low and behold, please be assured there is a dedicated network of users who work on this musical form, and the bands within, who are all highly experienced in the topic, and all work with, and sometimes against each other, to make the articles the best they can be.

For example, Babur could be taken as an Indian king as well as a persian. However, there is a subtle difference between categories such as Tamil people, Telugu people and People of Karnataka. The first two talk more of their language rather than region where as the Karnataka category doesn't talk of language. So, I would fall under people of Karnataka, though I can't manage even a smattering of Kannada. btw, there is nothing in the Radhakrishnan article to suggest that he spent time in Karnataka. Of the people listed in Category:Telugu people, only Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, imo, falls under both categories. On an unrelated note regarding copyrights, any photograph published in Indian media 50 years back or more i considered as Public Domain. Also, Tintin's view about 70 years after death is not correct because of the following reason - Copyright is given to the photographer and not to the subject, so the copyright expires only 70 years after the photographer's death, which is very difficult to determine.

It's a letter the Governing Body received in 1980 from the Watch Tower's chairman's committee, before the Governing Body disfellowshipped many senior Witnesses for ``apostasy``, and the reason was they were discussing these teachings below. I happen to agree with the points that disagree with traditional Watch Tower doctrine. You would also find it interesting reading Raymond Franz's discussion of each of these points in his two books, Crisis of Conscience and In search of Christian Freedom, and after see if you can still refute them using the Bible as your guide. The letter is below:   :Following are some of the wrong teachings being spread as emanating from Bethel. These have been brought to the attention of the Governing Body from the field from April 14 onward.  :1. That Jehovah does not have an organization on earth today and its Governing Body is not being directed by Jehovah.  :2. Everyone baptized from Christ's time (C.E. 33) forward to the end should have the heavenly hope. All these should be partaking of the emblems at Memorial time and not just those who claim to be of the anointed remnant.  :3. There is no proper arrangement as a ``faithful and discreet slave`` class made up of the anointed ones and their Governing Body to direct affairs of Jehovah's people. At Matthew 24:45 Jesus used this expression only as an illustration of faithfulness of individuals. Rules are not needed only follow the Bible.  :4. There are not two classes today, the heavenly class and those of the earthly class also called ``other sheep`` at John 10:16  :5. That the number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 is symbolic and not to be taken as literal. Those of the ``great crowd`` mentioned at Revelation 7:9 also serve in heaven as indicated in vs. 15 where it is claimed that such crowd serves ``day and night`` in his temple (naos) or K. int says: ``in the divine habitation of him.``  :6. That we are now living in a special period of ``last days`` but that the ``last days`` started 1900 years ago C.E. 33 as indicated by Peter at Acts 2:17 when he quoted from the prophet Joel.  :7. That 1914 is not an established date. Christ Jesus was not enthroned then but has been ruling in his kingdom since C.E.33. That Christ's presence (parousia) is not yet but when the ``sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven`` (Matthew 24:30) in the future.  :8. That Abraham, David, and other faithful men of old will also have the heavenly life basing such view on Hebrews 11:16.  :(Copy of letter, Page 316, Crisis of Conscience, by Raymond Franz.) `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 32915021, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 34, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 208, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 1840, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 467, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 1901, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 806, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 2687, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 1570, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 645, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 32915021, "2": 290, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.15, "1": 32923461, "2": -1, "3": -0.2}, "2": "I'm involved in this content dispute?

When I joined my first UU congregation, I was handed an envelope full of UUA-published pamphlets on various paths in UU, such as Buddhism, liberal Christianity, neo-Paganism and atheism.  Individual UUs may not be agnostic, but the denomination as a whole seems to meet that definition.  I don't think I've ever heard the sentiment ``it doesn't matter what you believe so long as you believe something,`` which I suppose could lead to a denomination being agnostic as a whole but disapproving of individual agnostics.

There never was a justification for merging Japanese and Chinese together on one page, and I should have realised from the beginning that this piggybacking of the Chinese contents onto the Japanese language page was a stupid mistake. Successive edits have rendered the page less and less readable, and the recent idiotic decision to merge the information on Chinese and Japanese punctuation, as well as the rewriting of a section which was originally entirely about Japanese into something which seems to be entirely about Chinese yet again indicates the carelessness and foolishness of very many so-called Wikipedians. I recently looked at the page about ``only write about what you know`` to find that it has been removed - Wikipedia, it seems, must be saddled with the efforts of illiterates and people who do not know what they are talking about. If I was actively involved in editing this encyclopedia, on the strength of the recent idiotic series of edits, I would revert out the Chinese language information and rename the page back to ``yokogaki and tategaki``. It used to be a good, well written, informative page. Now it is a mish-mash of badly written, confusing crud. Unfortunately what happened to this article is not an isolated example but an all-too-typical example of what ``Wikipedians`` seem to achieve - degeneration of article quality.

There are four other allophones (two between a and @ and two between o and u), which appear in unstressed syllables depending on the position of the unstressed syllable to the stressed syllable within a certain word. If you are posting also allophones and not only phonemes (the reasonable question is why you are doing this but we'll deal with this some other time), then the vowel chart should include all ten of them and not only eight with information which is an allophone and which is a phoneme. But you don't know that, do you?  Then we get to another reasonable question: why do you think that you can erase the whole vowel section with the vowel descriptions? Ha?   So: you post a chart which is WRONG and then you erase a section which is RIGHT. What the hell are you doing? I am getting tired of non-experts who read something somewhere and then come and try to wreak havoc on articles which they understand nothing about. A couple of months ago, one user was trying to change the article Bulgaria because he had read that the Bulgarians were descendants of the Shumers. In two words, your edit is pretty much of the same value and worth. For the phonetics section here, I've used the Routledge compendium on Slavic languages (1991) and the newest Bulgarian edition of New Bulgarian - phonetics, grammar and syntax.

Also, regarding the 1983 logo, I put the version on that was most associated before 1999 - the ``shadow`` logo. The pre-1999 logo had more stripes in the globe as the official logo, while the 8-stripe logo was used before 1999, according to a PDF article on bellsystemmemorial.com, was used when the logo was to be used in small dimension.

Some time ago, we were discussing the proposed deletion of wikipedians by politics and you made some good arguments in favor of keeping it. Now there still seems to be an ongoing dispute about whether these categories (and related userboxes) are factionalizing or not. I'm trying to find people who support the view that a users should be able to express themselves and their views freely on their user pages.

Further may I suggest that if you have any spare time, please: * go through what you have already uploaded to the commons and convert to use the {{geograph}} tag * go through what you have already uploaded here, the English wikipedia.

Where two or three people propose the same theory at appriximately the same time, there is commonly a debate about priority of parts and/or the whole, but not about ``re-discovery``.    Ah, I see, then you and I had something different in mind.  About priority: as is stated in the article, Poincar\u00e9 did not contest priority.  As to the why, my personal impression (given the information available to me, and I don't have all the information) my personal impression is that Poincar\u00e9 judged that Einstein was prematurely confident.  I figure that as seen from a 1905 perspective: if it would turn out that it would be impossible to formulate a Lorentz-invariant theory of gravitation, then the approach of uncompromising implementation of the principle of relativity of inertial motion would prove to be a dead end. My understanding is that in the years after 1905 (and to this day), the scientific community judged that Einstein's choice of avenue to follow was the best one. That would explain why Poincar\u00e9 didn't contest priority. If he judged Einstein's uncompromising attitude as a premature commitment, he wouldn't have wanted to be associated with it. Anyway, these considerations of mine are too speculative to be of value to the article. I fear that what I'm doing is not of good help to you, so I will try hard to keep a low profile.

Snakes are repugnant to most of us, which may be exactly why God used a ``serpent,`` or snake, as a symbol of Satan. We should naturally regard him as extremely repulsive.  Snake Satan is the greatest loser of all eternity. He was at one time an obedient, close servant of God - magnificent in appearance and position (Ezekiel 28:12-15). But he threw it all away through his rebellion, and was cast down to the earth (Ezekiel 28:16-17).  No one influenced Satan to sin the way that he now influences humans. Satan is an original. He decided solely by himself, he made the deliberate choice, to go from good to bad. See Could Satan Repent?  Satan is the Christian's greatest enemy, the most serious danger to one's eternal life. We need not live in fear of him however. Despite his now being much more powerful, we ultimately have the upper hand over him and all of his demons. We have the power of God's Holy Spirit to guide and protect us. See Why Demons Are Afraid Of You.  Satan's greatest weapon against us now is deception. Much of the world today cannot tell right from wrong, whether in matters of religion, or simple everyday life. So often what is wicked and despicable is actually glorified, while what is good and decent is sometimes viewed as somehow wrong or foolish. Satan is the ultimate expert at covering truth with lies and misconceptions. See What Does Satan Look Like?  The good news is that Satan has already lost. The Life, Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ has seen to that. The day is not far off when Satan is going to get all that is coming to him.  Fact Finder: What will be Satan's fate for all eternity? Revelation 20:10 As the rain poured down, it fell upon the roaring fires that were consuming everything within their reach, creating monstrous clouds of black smoke. The once lively village had been reduced to scattered lifeless forms and rubble.  Jacob Carter scowled at the destruction that had clearly been caused by one Goa'uld or another. The majority of the carcasses held wounds from a staff weapon blast, and foot prints could be found in the sandy soil.  The planet, Shara'lor, was at one point being utilized as a mining planet, and indigenous people as slaves. Evidently the Goa'uld had exhausted the planet's natural resources, and felt the need to destroy the members of the civilization who didn't meet the requirements to become hosts.  ``Jacob! We've found a survivor, however, she may not live much longer!``  Jacob followed the sound of Martouf's voice to the perimeter of the village where the trees became dense and nearly blocked out the sun entirely. On the ground, before Martouf and Nial, lay a young woman donned in lavender silks and red furs.  Jacob knelt beside the trembling form and checked her pulse: racing. If he listened closely, he could hear a wheezing that originated in the young woman's chest; her breathing was erratic and she gasped for any air she could catch. It was clear that the she was an asthmatic, it was equally clear that she would die without help.  Right about then, her chest was probably feeling as if an iron band was contracting around it. The wheezing was growing louder, her short gasps were rapid and extremely difficult. The wheezing caused a coughing fit, and between spasms, she struggled for air. When it was over, she was weak from the exertion, and her breathing had grown worse.  ``What's wrong with her?``  ``She's got something called asthma, and unless we do something soon, she's not going to live much longer.``  Martouf wasn't sure what to do, he was by no means knowledgeable of Tau'ri illnesses, consequently he had no idea as to how to cure them. Other than a blending.  ``Martouf, it's been determined that Ulrica will pass on shortly, leaving Thalan in need of a host.``  ``I thought the same, however...`` Martouf's voice trailed off, and he didn't really need to finish his sentence, for Jacob knew what he was thinking. This young girl might not be a willing host, and if that was a case...  ``Can you hear me?``  At the sound of Jacob's voice being directed at her, the young woman turned to look at him with the most stunning brown eyes. They were large and soulful, their color almost bordering on black. They showed her fright, and they pleaded with him for help.  ``We can save you, but in order for us to do that, you'll have to be blended... You'll have to share your physical body with another being, you understand? You'd be sharing your body... This being would be in your head, and you'd be able to hear it, but you'd be cured.``  The girl's eyes widened, and when she went to speak, another coughing fit began. It couldn't have even been called a cough, it was more of a painful hack that was slowly taking it's toll on her body. When it finally died down, she nodded vigorously at Jacob, but made no attempt to speak.  ``Jacob, not to contradict your judgment, but... Do we know for certain that she is trustworthy?``  Martouf had a point, but when Jacob looked down upon the young woman, he made his decision instantly. Her breathing was becoming increasingly shallower, and the itchy wheeze was causing her to cough again, which only made it worse. She was young, maybe sixteen or seventeen, and she certainly didn't deserve to die so early. They would take the risks and bring her back for a blending.  *'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-'.'-*  Jacob was seated by the bed on which Thalan's new host rested. She was peaceful now, breathing deeply and smoothly. The blending had been a perfect success; a few hours had passed since Thalan entered the young woman, and she would soon wake. Martouf remained with Jacob for most of the time after the blending, but he had been called away a few minutes previous.  The young woman had long black hair, and when she opened her eyes just before the blending, they had been the color of kohl. Her skin was an olive complexion that had been darkened a bit from the sun. She was fairly tall, at least 5'9, and thin, but muscular. Almost reminded him of an amazon woman from some movie he had seen several years preceding his blending.  The clothing she wore gave her a tribal appearance. Lavender silks embroidered with flowers wrapped around her lithe form to create a dress. The sleeveless coat made from reddish-brown fur indicated that her people were hunters. Her jewelry consisted of large hoop earrings with colorful beads, several necklaces of all lengths and colors and quite a few bangles. Feathers and beads had been added into a few tiny braids in her black hair.  Jacob's silent reverie was shattered by a shrill scream and the young woman's swift movement from the bed to the entranceway, where she was met by two Tok'ra guards. She had a crazed look in her eyes, terror elicited by the feeling of Thalan's memories, emotions, experiences and everything else merging with her own.  ``It's okay, don't worry, we're not going to hurt you. Just calm down and take a deep breath. Now, what's your name?``  The young woman looked as if she was going to scream again, but her legs gave out beneath her before she had a chance. Jacob caught her just in time, but as soon as she regained her strength she clawed at his arms.  ``Something's wrong with me! What have you done?!`` She demanded when Jacob pushed her away from him and stood up. He silently wished that Thalan would take control, but he knew the reason his friend was refraining from that action. Thalan knew that if she forced control on this frightened woman, there wouldn't be much hope at reasoning with her.  ``Calm down and I'll explain everything. But you have to *calm down*.``  ``Something's wrong, something's terribly, terribly wrong. There are memories and emotions and knowledge that is not my own. I... Oh, shit! Make it stop! Something's inside of me, I can sense it! Take it out! ``  ``Will you please just calm down and *listen* to me?``  She quieted and looked at the older man expectantly.  ``What's your name?``  ``Skyla Konrad.``  Two names. A first and a last. Not many civilizations had two names, other than those on Earth anyway. Konrad didn't sound 'alien'; it was, in fact, the name of someone he had gone to high school with.  ``Okay Skyla, you've been blended, and...``  ``Blended? Blended! What do you mean blended? As in with another human being?``  ``No, not another human, with a symbiote, a Tok'ra. The blending saved your life, and trust me, it has many advantages, I speak from personal experience. Besides, you consented back on that planet. I told you that you'd have to share your body.``  ``I don't care about the advantages! And do you really think that I was capable of coherent thought back on that planet?`` she paused, and seemed to be listening to something Jacob couldn't hear. She was listening to Thalan perhaps. ``Make it go away! Make it stop! There's a bloody voice and it's speaking to me! Make it stop!``  'Bloody'? Jacob doubted that many civilizations off of Earth used the term 'bloody'. He doubted *any* off-worlders used it.

Do you think I would be so adamant if I had something to hide vis a vis the clone/impersonation issue?  I will be very curious to see what your findings show, as I have my suspicions, but I will keep them to myself for now.  As I have repeatedly stated, the *only* anonymous edits I made were after my editing privileges were blocked, and then only to correct misinformation in the Farmer article, all of which has since been re-inserted by Wyss herself.  You're right, all I wanted was accuracya simple review of my very first post to Wyss' talk page will show (despite my improper posting etiquette, for which I have repeatedly apologized) that all I asked her to do was fact-check.  I am well aware of the Rashomon like qualities of attempting to discern the truth about Frances Farmer.  That indeed is why the subtitle to my article ``Shedding Light on Shadowland`` is indeed called The Truth About Frances Farmer.  That in turn is why my research has been used by A&E; Biography, NPR, the Washington Post, and, hilariously, the magazine Wyss apparently thinks discredits me, 'American Atheist.'  If you read Conrad Goeringer's article in 'American Atheist' you will find that I am his major source of information and, indeed, there is a whole secondary article about me and my findings vis a vis the false lobotomy allegations.  What bothers me about all of this is not the block (though Wyss says it's easy to get rescinded, I have yet to receive even a hint of how to do that, but that truly is not important to me), but Wyss' repeated assertions that I have sinister motives and, more importantly, have cloned her ID and/or impersonated her.  In terms of my motives, I have for over 20 years worked diligently to rid the world of misinformation about Frances Farmer, and I have been lauded internationally in the press and broadcast media for my attempts.  How is that sinsister?  In terms of the cloning/impersonation, what more can I say?  I have asked repeatedly for someone to do something technical to prove I didn't do it.  It seems that Wyss has had frequent run-ins with others, and perhaps I am the unwitting recipient of some pent-up frustration on her part.  As I have come to surmise, I am probably at least twice as old as most of you, and I am willing to cut you ``kids`` (joke) some slack, but I want these false allegations to stop and I am asking again for someone to do an IP trace and consclusively state publicly to Wyss and everyone involved that I had nothing to do with this clone ID/impersonation affair.`", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 36296834, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 654, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 2331, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 1681, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 245, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 69, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 290, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 35, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 793, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36296834, "2": 1576, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.10344827586206896, "1": 36302906, "2": -1, "3": -0.034482758620689655}, "2": "`  :::Maybe you can also ``mediate`` T-Man's insane edit on Legends of the Dark Knight...  `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 36302906, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 1303, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 997, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 488, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 2287, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 673, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 1437, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 663, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 591, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 536, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 525, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 493, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 1432, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 338, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 2541, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 840, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 286, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 841, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 282, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 200, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 192, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 187, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 166, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 146, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 145, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 8, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 5, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 842, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 1645, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36302906, "2": 1575, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": "  == Ashley Parker Angel ==  ", "4": "user", "5": "random", "1": 36303445, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 742, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 586, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 557, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 347, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 759, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 327, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 342, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36303445, "2": 22, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": -1, "3": 0.2222222222222222}, "2": "  ;Current *US 1 - Jefferson Davis Highway, 14th Street Bridges, [14th Street, Constitution Avenue, 6th Street](Southwest Freeway, 9th Street, L Street), 6th Street, Rhode Island Avenue *US 1 Alternate - [New York Avenue](L Street), New York Avenue, Bladensburg Road *US 29 - Lee Highway, Key Bridge, Whitehurst Freeway, K Street, 11th Street, Rhode Island Avenue, 7th Street, Georgia Avenue *US 50 - Arlington Boulevard, Roosevelt Bridge, Constitution Avenue, [Constitution Avenue, 6th Street, New York Avenue](9th Street, L Street), New York Avenue", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 36313539, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 2520, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 1802, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 1759, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 450, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 90, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 406, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 232, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 77, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 36313539, "2": 2394, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 36379832, "2": -1, "3": 0.1111111111111111}, "2": "  == Favourism towards International & out of province students ==  I moved this from the article because it's completely unreferenced and seems like original research.

Are you jealous, envious, or affraid of people who succeed? Maybe you'd be best to give up your life as a failure and join a commune, where you can spend your days feeling as equaly imcompeted as your fellow unsuccessful losers. At your commune, no one is superior and no one enjoys more success than others, therefore you don't have to feel ashamed of your lack of accomplishment. Do your edits make you feel important? Does your mommy or boyfriend control your life so much that you're only able to feel satisfaction in your life through the edits you demand? Enjoy yourself, Graemel.

I am a veteran journalist, writer, and editor with many years of experience. Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing ``edit warring`` which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and ``revert warriors`` who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the ``one-way`` pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being ``disruptive`` in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while ``revert warring`` without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as ``proof`` of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several ``reverts`` on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to ``revert war`` - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been ``revert warring`` for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and ``reverters`` who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the ``complaints`` about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to ``use`` him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.    `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 38714520, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 2161, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 2554, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 2843, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 667, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 196, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 1937, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 1543, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 38714520, "2": 683, "3": 1.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.2, "1": 38726527, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": " Numerically,according to the World Almanac 2005, only 350 million people worldwide are athiests. 700 million don't know what they believe.

I signed my comment with four tildes, at least the one that appeared on my own page.  I apologize if I posted it elsewhere in the wrong pace, or without a signature.

I, therefore, have left the building for a brief time.`` I see no  acknowledgment that he realizes that he lost his temper.  This in your inference.  But even were that true, and despite his apology to me, and his promise not to delete my posts (without addressing what he'll do to the posts of others), he has shown himself temperamentally unsuited to administrate.

That's at the core of this problem, you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox?  Rather, there is Jimbo saying there shouldn't be any.  I completely understand that he started this, but he is not owner of it, a foundation was set up, perhaps you've heard of it - the Wikimedia Foundation.  I didn't say you had that same point of view, I'm saying that I was just telling the people who do to fuck off.  I made no attack on any editor, that you perceive it as such is truly sad, but such is life.  Perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language.

Seifer and Squall's style of weaponry are the only ``gunsword`` weapons officially called ``gunblades`` in all of Final Fantasy.  Just thought I would point this out and make the correction.

This would be a great expansion project for some dedicated editors.   :I don't know how China treats Mormons, but my guess is that there are very few. The LDS church has a policy of not proselytizing in countries where doing so is illegal, so my guess is that there are very, very few native Chinese converts. There are some branches in China, but they're all English-speaking, and my guess would be that they are primarily foreign diplomats and business people and their families who are temporarily living in China.    PS: This talk page is massive and desperately needs archiving.    ::Au contraire, mon ami! (Forgive my bad french. It's actually more like misplaced ISO characters. Whatever.) The Church has a mission in Hong Kong that (coincidentally?) merged into China when China took Hong Kong back. There's even a temple there.    ::And college students. I met a large number of Chinese students at BYU. While not all convert, there is a significant group that does get baptised.

Well that isn't true...  The King Ranch in Texas is a 'bit' larger at 825,000 acres. http://www.king-ranch.com/index_ie.htm  I don't know how you would like to correct the information.  I don't know if you can say that it is the second largest as there isn't a list of top 10 ranches out there I could find.    It is a very large ranch by any measure but not the largest.  :Agree we should change or clarify. Do you know which is larger in production? -   ==Freemasonry==  It is very interesting to find there is no reference in this article to Freemasonry, which is where almost all of the ritual in Mormon worship derives it's origin, even down to the under-garments and the symbolism thereof.  Has anyone considered investigating this further, or is such discussion offensive to Mormons?     ... I don't think it's considered offensive, but probably inaccurate. It may be said that, but such a statement lacks any substantiation and is therefore not a Neutral POV. you can say that some people think that ``Mormon`` rituals derive from freemasonry, but you'd also have to say that Latter day saints themselves believe that their ``rituals`` come instead by revelation.

These things have not been ignored.    ... [Comment by Trenidor] I don't think it's in anyway related to freemasonry, All of the beliefs are contained in already published and readily accessable sources such as: The Church's Magazines, The Book of Mormon, the Docterin and Covenants, as well as the many Confrence talks and any published work by the church.

I have absolutely no relationship of any kind with Jbetak, and have never, to the best of my knowledge, sent him a message or received one from him. You are obviously confusing him with Jdavidb, who posted a message on my talk page this evening, to which I have responded. I have a lot of respect for Jdavidb, as a very courteous, balanced editor, who respects NPOV, and does not edit war. I have never met him outside of Wikipedia, but I did read a message he posted on some blog asking people to join Wikipedia nearly a year ago, and I joined partly if not wholly as a result of that. There is a big difference between on the one hand two independent editors meeting at Wikipedia and later discovering as a happy coincidence that one of them arrived in response to what might be seen as an ``ad`` placed by another, and on the other hand an editor running out of reverts, getting his wife to join and revert to his version, and sending camouflage messages to her talk page to give other editors the impression that they had never met, while suggesting that Str1977 and KHM03 were sockpuppets, that I was a meatpupptet, and using the words ``sneaky`` and ``hypocrisy`` about me. For the record, while I think highly of Jdavidb, we hardly ever edit the same articles.

They point out that Che Guevara was responsible for the torture and execution of hundreds of people in Cuban prisons, and the murder of many more peasants in the regions controlled or visited by his guerrilla forces. Contrary to Che supporters, these critics also argue that Che was a blundering tactician with no recorded combat victories. They claim that Che failed medical school in Argentina and that there is no evidence that he earned a medical degree.  They note that Che murdered individuals on dubious grounds and took their property, seized private manors for himself, and distributed property among communist bureaucrats rather than the peasants. The also state that he not only oversaw the prison, over which he ordered the execution of hundreds if not thousands of Cubans, but also helped institute forced labor camps when volunteerism failed.

I'm kind of new to it, and there doesn't seem to be a talk/editing facility. So I'm going to post this here, hope that's okay. Their article on the Prophet Mohammed includes the following text:  By his own standards, the continuing traditions of social justice in the Islamic World, of methods and knowledge of science, history and medicine as they evolved in the modern world (thanks to his profound influence driving Muslims to literacy and inquiry), and the prayers of over one billion Muslims, many of whom pray for him five times a day (or attach `` peace be upon him`` after each mention of his name), render Muhammad arguably the most influential man in all history, an honour often reserved for Jesus in the West. Even those historians who have deplored his influence and considered it to have retarded the growth of its chief rival faith, Christianity, express grudging admiration for the man.  and this:  To the traitors inside Medina it must have come as a surprise when the 10,000-strong force of Abu Sufyan failed to cross a trench dug around Medina by order of Muhammad, as the Persian scribe Salman e-Farsi had suggested to him. After the retreat of Abu Sufyan and his forces, the Muslims directed their attention towards the groups that had committed treason to the Charter of Medina. The munafiqun quickly crumbled, and their leader Abd Allah ibn Ubayy pledged allegiance to Muhammad. The Muslims then besieged the Banu Qurayza, who had intrigued against them. They had the opportunity of choosing Muhammad as an arbitrator, but instead the Banu Qurayza chose Saad ibn Muadh, the leader of their former allies, the Aus.  And this is its take on the Battle of Badr, 624 CE, which is markedly different to that found in the Wikipedia article (which raises doubts about the aftermath of the battle):   On March 15, 624 near a place called Badr, the two forces clashed. Though outnumbered 800 to 300 in the battle, the Muslims met with success, killing at least 45 Makkans, including Abu Jahl, and taking 70 prisoners; whereas only 14 Muslims died. To the Muslims this appeared as a divine vindication of Muhammad's prophethood, and he and all the Muslims rejoiced greatly. Following this victory, assassinations eliminated Medinans who had satirized Muhammad, and the victors expelled a hostile Jewish clan. Virtually all the remaining Medinans converted and Muhammad became de facto ruler of the city.   I had the idea that Wapipedia was a direct transfer of Wikipedia articles onto Wap, but it seems not.

The article is a good candidate for speedy deletion.  `", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 40831198, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 652, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1166, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1634, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1151, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1148, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1146, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1106, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1063, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1043, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 931, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 864, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 787, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 1139, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 575, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 655, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 96, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 3, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 212, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 571, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40831198, "2": 131, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.4444444444444444, "1": 40860509, "2": -1, "3": -0.8888888888888888}, "2": "moved to http://www.freearchive.org/wiki2/index.php/Tape_editing for safety (the wikipedia idiots don't want to include this page)  ", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 40860509, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 2364, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 3038, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 1023, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 982, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 883, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 2023, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 3033, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 205, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 40860509, "2": 475, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 40893274, "2": -1, "3": 0.1111111111111111}, "2": "   What do you mean it is hardly true I have proved without a shadow of a doubt that during the war the axis hade many times more raw materieals.

If anyone wants to read about the hooligan incidents, the suitable place is the hooliganism section where it is explained further with the incidents happened in the past. I strongly insist that the pages of sports clubs are only for official information related to the club's themselves. I also remind you that Galatasaray was not punished by UEFA for that incident because neither the place nor the reason of the incident was related to Galatasaray,unlike the Heysel disaster which took place *inside the stadium* on the day of the match. It was 100% a football related matter. For reasons already discussed, the Leeds - Galatasaray murders were a civil matter, even though the victims and perpertrators were both football fans. That's why it is not appropriate to include that article here since even the International football committee did not relate it with the club of Galatasaray.", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 41152890, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 3003, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 3012, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 2999, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 3004, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 1071, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 3006, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 1637, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 1769, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 30, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41152890, "2": 3008, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.46153846153846156, "1": 41208177, "2": -1, "3": -0.5769230769230769}, "2": " Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block Block   ", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 41208177, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 1086, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 673, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 1821, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 840, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 288, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 2467, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 282, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 214, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 192, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 39, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 1303, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 1338, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 842, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 668, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 451, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 569, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 452, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 464, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 514, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 536, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 565, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 447, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 704, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 733, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 1391, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 41208177, "2": 1547, "3": -3.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 41257983, "2": -1, "3": 0.3333333333333333}, "2": " :It was suggested by someone before I ever came to the article.

For analysis of origin of laugnage, grammer is not the most important element. High end words such as academic terms  (greek or latin in English) or words describing foreign import (french in English) is the easiest to change.  Just because English contain lot of french, latin words doesn't make this Germanic language into a romanic language.   Then come the grammer. This is one hot potatoe in ``Altaic`` language controversy. Though Mongolian, Turkish, Manchurian, Korean and Japanese all have similar syntax structure which indicate shared ``proto`` Altaic origin, some argue that these syntax is not actually a structured syntax system but a syntax system which lost much of syntax rule. ``Altaic`` language is characterised by highly flexible sentence structure where writing can go on and on without full stop. This is because it utilise SOV (subject, object, verb) syntax or more importantly passive OVS syntax (or just OV) with use lot of which/what/when to connect sub sentence. You can see this from how I write. English on the other hand, is considered to have one of most rigid syntax system and is one of the main reason Japanese or Korean find English grammer hard to grasp. If you know Japanese, for example, most Japanese conversation doesn't make sence in itself. Conversation is just exchange of noun, like ``(Done) this?`` ``(Do) this``, ``(Do you want) this?`` or even worse, ``(Have you bought) Milk (I asked you to buy this morning)?`` This is one reason why Japanese is one of the easiest language to ``speak`` at elementary level. Subsequently, those oppose to proto-Altaic linguist theory argue that there are not such thing as proto Altaic laugnage(grammer), rather the similarity is a result of high degree of interaction between these normadic groups, which resulted in flexible syntax.   Relating to this Altaic controversy is the importance of pronounciation system and commonly used words (eat, take, rice, etc). In linguistic, this is more important than grammer because pronounciation and common words are more resilenent to change. And Korean and Japanese share very little verb or commonly used nouns not to mention totally different pronounciation system. Therefore, no linguist would put current Japanese and Korean language in the same linguistic group. This also apply to Korean which is derived from Sillian. Sillian/Korean pronounciation and commonly used words is distinctly different from not just Japanese but also Mongolian and Manchurian. Some argue, based on some reference in ancient Chinese text, that Sillian may have been a off shoot of Han, (though pronounciation lost much of tune aspect) through interaction with largely Tungustic tribes. Anyway, as far as Japanese goes, it is somewhat regarded as creole language between malay/polinesian pronoucniation and Tungustic syntax.

Any wrong information should be removed from the articles and, be sure, it will be removed. This my positive contribution to the Wikipedia. It improves the quality of the resource, because wrong information is much worse than lack of information. If you are not agree and would like put the information back, please folow the Wikipedia_official_policy and cite a cite credible sources. Switch yourself to a constructive work, it will help you to find mutural understanding with most of Wikipedians, including myself.   ::Couldn't agree more...   You both must really have guts to say this. I mean that's funny who's talking about propaganda machine.    ::Well, it simply seems that providing no sources when asked to is nothing uncommon in your modus operandi. Or am I wrong? (BTW, no offence intended, just a friendly note).   Halibutt, you may turn this into an ethics dispute if you want. I would only welcome you or this fellow to start an RfC against me to expose your unsourced POV pushing and my attempt to resist that to which you respond with personal attacks. As for your ``no offence``, I take everything you said at the face value and I am capable to figure out your intentions from what you say rather than from what you claim you are saying.    ::I merely pointed to the fact that, apparently, I'm not the only person to ask you for sources - as politely as I could - and not the onbly person you ignored, contrary to the good ol' Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:Cite sources rules. If you take it as an offence - I can't do much about it, can I.    Halibutt, how many times do I have to say that this is not about sources. This is about the liberty you take to interprete them and derive conclusions you favor that are just not there. And never have I ``ignored``. If you refuse to see the answers repeated so many times, I can't do much about it, can I? We can only wait for others to agree or disagree whether the answers to your and my conserns are adequate. Those ``others`` didn't show up for a while. Still no reason to beleive that the dispute was somehow solved by itself.  As for your claimed ``politeness`` the article's talk page speaks for that. But as for ``offence``, if I were so easily offended, I would not be able to be at Wikipedia. We all have seen worse than that. It is not for thin-skinned to edit history articles. You should see AndriyK's language he used and even that didn't make me loose my sleep.    ==Ru Pravda== Dear Irpen! Sorry if I chose the wrong words for expressing my frustration with AndriyK's behavior. I didn't mean to hurt anybody's feelings. It's just that I've seen a lot of stuff done to a few of my articles that deal with Ukraine's people or geography in one way or another, so I decided to stay away from such topics. I appreciate your hard work in the Russian Portal! Keep it up and see you there.   :If it wasn't done by AndriyK lately, it was probably done by people who aren't on WP for months. Were there any recent incidents? I would love to see more Russian editors helping at UA-portal. In fact I called for that repeatedly as well as to Polish boards. With a few exceptions we never had serious  conflicts. If you can, please do contribute to Ukrainian articles.     == Ukraine related topics ==  Irpen, I would try to support you, although my knowledge of Ukrainian history is mostly limited to Soviet schoolbooks, and discourse is mostly the imperialistic one. I like your edits better, thou I am not sure if it is the right way to weed out all the Polish names from the cities that were Polish. Would it hurt that much if we would add the third (Polish) name in the first string if they want it so badly?   :No it would not always hurt. It will help in some and would hurt in some other cases. I will explain later, have to go now. Thanks   ::I agree with your explanations, OK, lets go into the edit war   :::Dear maffiosi, I don't think the edit war is a lasting solution. Perhaps it's time to discuss Andriy's disruptive policies at the Administrators' notice board? During his stint in the Wiki, he didn't contribute anything valuable but spelling reverts and personal attacks on other editors. May we ask to ban him?   We may ask to ban him but, as I told him at his talk page, I was trying to avoid it as much as I could. He violated 3RR multiple times and I showed it to him warning that he may get banned but I never actually proceeded in listing him for banning. Besides, after 24-48 hour ban he will be back even more aggravated and will continue his crusade with even more rigor. He may also find ways to circumvent 3RR or simply stay just under it and this pain will go on.   On the other hand, IMO he've done enough for the full-blown arbitration, which may result in a longer ban. If anyone would want to compile an arbitration case, I will comment on it. But as of yet, I would not start it myself. Several people are trying to talk to him and I hope he would listen. But if nothing changes, he will en up banned for sure.    :I think your position is fine. Just one question, is it absolutely, positively provent that OUN authorized the Lvov pogrom and it was not a spontaneus action? If its not 100% proven, we might add some NPOV hedging, like most of the scolars believe..., etc., not just blankly link the pogrom to OUN.   I  agree that there are differences of opinions on this. The article provides references that support both versions and both should be mentioned. I explained that some of the sources brought up by this user are controversial but this is no reason to totally dismiss them. What I oppose is that the user simply blanks from the article a sourced version he doesn't like.    == Discussion on maidanua.org ==  Hi, I've read that discussion with some interest. Your characterization as ``User Irpen is a very cunning, ingenious, and stubborn troll.`` (``\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0447 Irpen - \u0434\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0445\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439, \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0456 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c.``) was especially amusing. What can I say - \u0446\u0456 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0456 \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0456\u043c \u0437 \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0437\u0434\u0443 \u0437'\u0457\u0445\u0430\u043b\u0438. Maybe, not all of them, but a significant proportion for sure.   :Now you are in danger too ). But seriously, it just hurts. Really, I mean you probably saw what was going on in en-Wiki and had no time to interfere. I took it upon myself to deal with this and I am getting all the heat now. (. And now this slander. I tried all I can to talk to user AndriyK. I was accused in Ukrayinophobia by someone else who retracted it and we are even having a decent correspondance now. But I just don't want to leave something to which I gave so much time. Just check my recent edit history to get a clue. Well, anyway, if I stay I might need help. If you have time, just try to talk to these new people if you can't participate in editing for the lack of time. I tried and I am getting this. Michael tried too. He was not cursed (perhaps because he has an orange ribbon on his page )). Still, he was just ignored. I don't know. If this goes on, we need to engage new editors in productive editing or repell this attack. Or leave ourselves. But this is the last thing I want to do...    ::I understand it was very offensive. But you shouldn't worry too much - there are always crazy people out there.  And how do we know he is not paid for what he does? It may be a form of an information war strategy. Similar to specifically hired participants in popular forums, like pravda.com.ua or inosmi.ru. They often pick an active user and start dumping sh-t on him. You would be quite a natural choice.

I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.  If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ```` link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ``Image`` from the dropdown box.

By calling everyone under the age of 18 a ``child``, which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called ``children,`` and if you start using terms like ``teenage sex`` and ``teenage sex with adults`` to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the ``poor little abused children`` angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a ``baby.``  Then all sex with minors could be ``poor little babies being abused and raped,`` which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman's, John Ashcroft's, and David Finkelhor's of the world.  When such semantic games have to be employed to sell an agenda, with disqualification of everyone holding a different perspective as ``perpetuating the abuse``, what you have is pseudo-science and flim-flam, and not unbiased reporting. 20:10`", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 43015917, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 1.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 1167, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 1165, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 1157, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 1166, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 1140, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 177, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 0, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 1168, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 3, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 43015917, "2": 1146, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.9, "1": 43020569, "2": -1, "3": -2.6}, "2": "  Fuckwad... you deleted my page.", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 43020569, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 3562, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 1694, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 2631, "3": -2.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 3546, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 3555, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 3565, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 3590, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 3581, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 3564, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 43020569, "2": 1648, "3": -3.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 43040349, "2": -1, "3": 1.0}, "2": "` Welcome!

At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, ``pedophile trolling,`` which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship.  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a ``personal attack,`` and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.  Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are ``copyright violations``, even though Wikipedia is filled with ``fair use`` pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs.  Mr. Berry is a news story.  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article.     Way to go Jimbo, you're a rancid agenda-pushing piece of shit, and I greatly regret having contributed to your encyclopedic turd-pile.

My regards,  Thomas Colignatus   DRAFT  To the president of MIT Professor Susan Hockfield http://web.mit.edu/hockfield/ hockfield@mit.edu  To the dean of SIMS, University of California at Berkeley Professor Hal Varian http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hal/ hal@sims.berkeley.edu   March 11, 2006    Dear professors Hockfield and Varian, Dear Hal,  I have a problem on the integrity of science with two of your students, Rob Speer at MIT who started the problem, and Joseph Lorenzo Hall at SIMS who is interfering in an unhelpful way. The problem is summarized in the appendix.  Obviously, the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academics so there must be a great deal of tolerance with students. With students, they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can, and they are only learning the trade. Yet, students e.g. know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. When issues of integrity arise, it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. In this case, these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity.  In the present case, the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet, in particular wikipedia. It appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. My reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat.  It is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. My impression is that this relation exists. Firstly, they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of MIT and SIMS, thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there, implying their relation to you. Secondly, they are active in editing work, where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. Their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. This is most clearly so with Joseph Lorenzo Hall who is already a Ph.D. student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. For Rob Speer, who started the problem, it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose.  In the end, it is with students similar as with academics: An academic can still be a good academic \u201cprofessionally\u201d even if he or she steals roses from the neighbours or tells gossips to friends in church, but, the expectation would be that that behaviour would not occur. The expectation would be decent behaviour, worthy of an intended graduate or doctor, especially when the integrity of science is involved.  The relation to your school also arises directly from the nature of their misconduct. When a student behaves badly in an area that he sees as distinct from his education, it can be educational to him or her to be reminded that this behaviour does not fit a graduate, for which the very education is intended. As said, I kindly ask you to find a teacher or counselor within your institution to discuss matters on a personal level with those students. I already tried to explain it to them via the contact that is provided by the internet, but this didn\u2019t help, and my hope is that such a talk on a personal level would help them to see the problem.   Unfortunately, the student Rob Speer only provided the co-ordinate \u201ca senior at MIT studying computer science and music\u201d (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rspeer) and explicitly refused to give a name and email address of his professor. There appear different organizations dealing with computer science at MIT, so I can only write to the President, professor Hockfield, with the polite request to forward this issue to the appropriate person. To my relief, though, I noted a speech by professor Hockfield where she discussed academic integrity, in the case of two scientists at Lincoln Laboratory, so I have been confirmed that integrity has her attention.  The Ph. D. student Joseph Lorenzo Hall can be identified via http://josephhall.org/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Joebeone, joehall@berkeley.edu. At the present, SIMS is smaller than MIT, so I suppose that professorVarian can identify this student with some ease.   Both students have been informed of this letter, via the email addresses on their webpages.  For the information of professor Hockfield I may add that I had brief contact with professor Varian some years ago, notably on his economics programs for Mathematica and my Economics Pack, applications of Mathematica. (This Pack has decent quality. Once I sold via a third party, Wolfram Research Inc., but they resold unexpectedly to other resellers, halving my margin, so I had to stop that outlet.) Professor Hockfield might also inquire with professor Blanchard at MIT, since he once gave a lecture in Holland and met me; though it seems he hasn\u2019t had time yet to study my work, so I mention his name only with great hesitation.

I feel that if I responded anyway (and I wanted to), despite him telling me to leave him alone, he would've blocked me also.

I already emailed TShilo that I agreed to have a mentor. (I was told in another chatroom that having a mentor is generally not a bad thing.) He says he has to find someone willing to mentor me. I wonder if you can too, in order to speed up the process.

I can provide you with many examples if you would like.  I know that you have seen first-hand what can happen with the homosexuality-related articles, but this particular article is a disgrace.  I have gone through all of the proper channels to raise a red flag about this.  The first item on the ``workshop`` page is a request to ``remove the article`` .  But, so far, that option has not been added to the ``proposed remedies`` section of the ``requests for arbitration`` page .

The first is not even the ``original`` logo... it's simply another promotional image for the most recent album.   Yes, sports teams have multiple logos. This is not a sports team though, now is it? Do you see the Linkin Park page with all of Linkin Park's numerous logos? No, it simply has pictures of the albums and bands. It is a far lengthier article as well. Look at similar articles of similar length: Adema, Slipknot, 311 (band), Alkaline Trio, Audioslave, Velvet Revolver, Blink-182, Cold (band), Disturbed, Evanescence, etc.  None have as many pictures, and they're all longer.`", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 46258878, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 1.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1949, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1097, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1216, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1221, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 784, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 566, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 165, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1238, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 148, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 143, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 66, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 47, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 43, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1259, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1598, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1604, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1646, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 1799, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 926, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46258878, "2": 898, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 46330077, "2": -1, "3": 0.1111111111111111}, "2": "  == Image:505logo.PNG tagging ==  I've changed the tagging on Image:505logo.PNG to  because while you made it, it is a direct copy of the 505 logo and is the same shape, size, and arrangement as http://www.int505.org/505_logo.gif.

One hope I have in proposing this parallel-article scheme is to get two articles started for each episode, advancing both the MST3K content and adding to the WikiProject Films work. Placing detailed synopses in the MST3K articles would be redundant and even misleading, as many MSTied films have elements that are missing in their edited versions (not necessarily to sabotage, as some suspect, but clearly to trim their lengths). Both the episodes and the films deserve articles that discuss their distinct qualities: the films for their own values (however questionable or amusing), and the episodes, for which the film plots are only riff fodder. ~ \u00a0 `", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 46588362, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 3334, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2590, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2978, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2755, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2589, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2979, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2588, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2980, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2509, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 46588362, "2": 2447, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.2222222222222222, "1": 46608784, "2": -1, "3": -0.5555555555555556}, "2": "`  == Jeepers ==  I just came looking for info on Madame Sosostris and I found this preening custerfluck instead.

If you feel it should be smaller, feel free to resize it. lol about the (m), (n) and (m+n) labels! They aren't even remotely supposed to indicate lengths of sides. They're supposed to indicate which number to multiply each of the sides with; I thought it would be helpful in understanding Apollonius' theorem.

On the one hand, if you do research using an instrument such as the 16PF, yes, you do ``replicate`` the factor structure.  For example, when the researchers at IPAT wrote hundreds of brand new 16PF items during the development of the 16PF, administered them to hundreds of volunteers, and then performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses... Yes, the factors were confirmed. Both in factor-analyses of the new scales and in analyses of the old and new forms.  But the same is true of the NEO with it's 30 facets and Hogam's HPI with it's dozens of HIC's.  So if you mean, ``Do researchers agree on any breakdown of the five broad factors?`` then no.  Since the choice of factors is somewhat arbitrary, there is no reason to expect that they would agree.  But my point are that: (1) the big five is far too broad, so (2) virtually all commercial personality tests have adopted this two-stage model and (3) I have seen evidence (like Lew Goldberg's unpublished ``Comparitive validity`` chapter) that convinces me that these facets have significantly higher validity than the broad traits, even after you account for the different numbers of predictors (by using empirical cross-validation, in the case of Lew's chapter).  Goldberg's chapter actually found that the 16PF factors were most predictive of all factorial models (e.g., NEO-5, NEO-30, Hogan-6, Hogan-36, etc.)  And I guess your also asking whether anyone has done the same things Cattell did and gotten the same results.  That's not as cut-and-dried as you suggest.  AFAIK, only one replication has been attempted (by Norman?) and it's true, he didn't find the same results.  But one contrary finding does not constitute a stunning refutation and I'd argue that Norman's different findings could easily reflect that exploratory factor analysis is a poor way to replicable factors.  There are far too many judgments required (like **how many factors to extract** which is absoluetly **not** a solved problem).   `", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 47525177, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 1987, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 2511, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 467, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 960, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 1057, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 353, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 136, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 127, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 122, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 98, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 11, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 3701, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 1567, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 402, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 523, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 707, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 1621, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 1640, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 1795, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47525177, "2": 890, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 47536006, "2": -1, "3": 0.26666666666666666}, "2": "  == Abdullah \u00d6calan ==  Hi, could you tell me why you reverted my edit on Abdullah \u00d6calan.

There are no exceptions. Anything that you are involved in on Wikipedia that has to do with something or someone in Vaughan should stop totally. That includes the RfD. That doesn't mean you have to remove it, but just leave it alone. Trust the admins.   Leotardo, I thank you for agreeing with this proposal in principle. I'm glad you are willing to participate in the process. I agree with your ends. So to Pm_shef: you must agree to concede the two concerns Leotardo has, in the spirit of co-operation.  Pm_shef mentioned the Susan Kadis article that he wanted to research for; but though the 10 hour time expired, there are still no such edits. I'm sure it doesn't mean that he isn't taking this process seriously.   So Pm_shef and Leotardo, and myself, we have 10 hours before all the editing noted above will totally cease. Pm_shef is to add his objective Kadis research, and Leotardo will have his two edits added, before the 10 hours expires. I will go and do that now. So again, in 10 hours, if you agree, all such editing is to stop.  `", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 47912993, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 1207, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 1452, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 1564, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2350, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 252, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 335, "3": 2.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2205, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2790, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2352, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 475, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 562, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 1188, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2285, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 1003, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 828, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 756, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 684, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 1872, "3": -1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2056, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 601, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2026, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2019, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 594, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 610, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2282, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 47912993, "2": 2284, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.1, "1": 47920828, "2": -1, "3": 0.0}, "2": " :Exactly what's wrong with the article?

My name's Jim Heller and I'm currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco.  The background is this.  I am a former follower of Prem Rawat, a/k/a Maharaji, a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader.  Fresco, on the other hand, is a current follower and, needless to say, of a different mind altogether.   For some years now, ever since the advent of the internet, Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long-standing campaign to whitewash Rawat's past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history.  The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat's current followers, a religious studies professor in fact, Ron Geaves (who, by the way, just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were ``demonstrators``, not ``terrorists``.     Please excuse the fact that, to explain the problem in any meaningful way, I have to flesh out the context somewhat.  My edit concerned an academic (not Wikipedia) article Geaves had written where, discussing a program Rawat held in 1973, he wrote that: In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.  (My emphasis here and below)  In fact, a widely-disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program, Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the ``millenial expectations`` but fanned the flames substantially.  Thus, he declared the program the ``most Holy and significant event in human history`` and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:  A LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI   Bonn, Germany   September 31, 1973   Dear premies,   First of all, I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all, it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. For it is something they really need.   In the world there is suffering, hatred and dissatisfaction. That fact does not need proof. It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God. There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people. We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace, for peace lies inside not outside in materialism.   As you all know Millenium '73 is being prepared for now. This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967, in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday. This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America.   I think that Millenium '73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner.   To do this I really need your help. I really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically, financially and all other ways to make Millenium '73 come off. This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe.   I hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace, Millenium '73 and request all premies to help me financially, physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth.   Isn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth?   Blessings to you all,   [Sant Ji Maharaj]     It is clear, when you contrast Geaves' claim with the documentary evidence, that Geaves, bless his heart, is playing the role of the typical cult apologist, lying about his leader and blaming the followers, the press, anyone at all, for the inexcusable, laughable excesses of the cult.  What's particularly worrying about Geaves, I'm sure you can appreciate, is that, as a religious studies professor, he's imbued with a certain authority that makes him an especially effective, if unscrupulous, propagandist.  It's one thing when he makes silly comments about the July 7 bombers being ``demonstrators`` not terrorists.  No one would ever take him seriously on that score.  But it's another altogether when he publishes supposedly-scholarly works about his cult leader (without ever disclosing that he's a follower, by the way) which completely distort the historical record.   With these concerns in mind, I wrote the following additional comment for Geaves' Wikipedia article:   Geaves has written a couple of articles about Prem Rawat, his guru, for various scholarly journals without publically disclosing in those pieces that he is a follower of Rawat (a/k/a Maharaji). Critics of Geaves allege that these works are dissembling, revisionist propaganda and far too biased and inaccurate for proper scholarship. For instance, in a 2006 article, Geaves commented on the ``Millenium`` festival Rawat held in Houston in 1973, noting that ``The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S. with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors. Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations. He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.`` However, in a letter that Rawat himself wrote inviting followers to the festival, he called it ``the most Holy and significant event in human history``. And later, ``This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe.``  Now you may think that this isn't quite NPOV enough.  You may think it requires more specific attributions.  You may even think it isn't particularly well-written.  But these are all matters which can be discussed and worked on in a Wikipedian collaborative spirit.  Instead, what happened was Jossi Fresco, a paid web tech for Rawat (Maharaji), who stands guard dog over the Rawat articles for his master, anonymously began deleting my text and inserting, instead, this:   Dr. Geaves has also written a number of papers related to Maharaji and affiliated organizations to combine his first hand knowledge of the subject (Geaves is a student of Maharaji) with his academic training to provide insights into this movement [2]  As indicated on the Talk: Ron Geaves page, eventually Fresco admitted that he was the deleter.  We then got into a big tug-o-war wherein I would reinsert my text and warn him to quit reverting and he would then blame me for reverting in contravention of the Wiki excessive reversion rule.  At one point he siezed on the fact that I posted without remembering to log in (I'm a bit new at this), accusing me of trying to sneak in via a sockpuppet or whatever you call them.  Hardly.  I've never denied my identity which has been apparent to Fresco all along.  Like I said, he was the one who started the anonymous vandalism of my edit before finally coming out of the shadows.  After all this, though, the nub of the issue is this: who was the original editor here and who was performing the illicit reversions?  How can I be fairly accused of too many reversions for simply trying to protect my own original edit against his vandalism?  Believe me, Jossi Fresco is the first to complain when the shoe's on the other foot, namely when someone changes some text this way.  So how can he have it both ways?    I know that Fresco has wormed his way into some sort of admin position with Wikipedia but that's just a potential embarrassment for this institution.  This is just one example but things like this happen all the time with him.  That's why the Prem Rawat articles are so terrible, really.  They have very little substance, their focus is all off and, frankly, they're just boring, whitewashed advertisements for this cult.  And Fresco's largely responsible.  I look forward to your considered reply.

Xerox pages of a book I, unlike you, read 2 years ago ? And which proves-what ? That in Star\u010devi\u0107's political career the term ``Slavosrb`` was used exclusively for enemies (as he saw them) of Croatian independence ? The main ``Slavosrbs`` were Strossmayer, Germans, Hapsburg monarchy, and the so-called ``Khuen Serbs``- the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the  hated political regime of oppression. How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia, more than 98%, had been, during the most oppressive period in the 19th century,  collaborators of Khuen regime ? Truly-these Serbs (or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally ``awoke`` as Serbs in mid- and 2nd half of the 19th century) had fully deserved the ``Slavosrbs`` tag in Star\u010devi\u0107's lingo-unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were Star\u010devi\u0107's followers (Stjepan Mileti\u0107, August Haramba\u0161i\u0107, Du\u0161an Kotur, Du\u0161an Vlaisavljevi\u0107, Milan Ogrizovi\u0107,..).

But, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107's pan-Serbian ideology.

I have been asked previously to give my vote on the disputes. I voted and I take the responsibility for it. If you read my comments on the same page, you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view, without mentioning any specific point about you. To me the story was over. However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion. As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way. I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints. I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies, they actually did so. And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages. About Cyrus, I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me. The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible. I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation. We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups. National heros, prophets, Gods etc are things that we should comment very carefully on them. Besides, you are by no means an expert on these issues. About your alleged ethnicity, it is not important whether you are Persian or Kurd, Iranian or Russian. You need to revise your views. If you were persian, you would need an even more extensive revision. This is only a suggestion and my personal viewpoint.   ==", "4": "user", "5": "blocked", "1": 48382758, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 3845, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 1583, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 1944, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 1.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 2360, "3": -3.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 1453, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 289, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 3472, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 1580, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 48382758, "2": 612, "3": 1.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 48404261, "2": -1, "3": 0.2}, "2": "  :Yes, no hit and run tags please.

But the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now. From them split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Touga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land. After they had fought one another for some vears, the Croats prevailed and killed some of the Avars and the remainder they compelled to be subject to them. And so from that time this land was possessed by the Croats, and there are still in Croatia some who are of Avar descent and are recognized as Avars. The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, white Croats, and have their own prince ; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, or Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia a part split off and possessed themselves of Illyricum and Pannonia ; they too had a sovereign prince, who used to maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the prince of Croatia. For a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia also were subject to the Franks, as they had formerly been in their own country ; but the Franks treated them with such brutality that they used to murder Croat infants at the breast and cast them to the dogs. The Croats, unable to endure such treatment from the Franks, revolted from them, and slew those of them whom they had for princes. On this, a large army from Francia marched against them, and after they had fought one another for seven years, at last the Croats managed to prevail and destroyed all the Franks with their leader, who was called Kotzilis. From that time they remained independent and autonomous,.... .................. These baptized Croats will not fight foreign countries outside the borders of their own ; for they received a kind of oracular response and promise from the pope of Rome who in the time of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, sent priests and baptized them. For after their baptism the Croats made a covenant, confirmed with their own hands and by oaths sure and binding in the name of St. Peter the apostle, that never would they go upon a foreign country and make war on it, but rather would live at peace with all who were willing to do so ; and they received from the same pope of Rome a benediction to this effect, that if any of the pagans should come against the country of these same Croats and bring war upon it, then might the God of the Croats fight for the Croats and protect them, and Peter the disciple of Christ give them victories. ............... Again, Symeon sent another army against prince Zacharias, under Kninos and Himnikos and Itzboklias, and together with them he sent also Tzeeslav. Then Zacharias took fright and fled to Croatia, and the Bulgarians sent a message to the 'zupans' that they should come to them and should receive Tzeeslav for their prince ; and, having tricked them by an oath and brought them out as far as the first village, they instantly bound them, and entered Serbia and took away with them the entire folk, both old and young, and carried them into Bulgaria, though a few escaped away and entered Croatia ; and the country was left deserted. Now, at that time these same Bulgarians under Alogobotour entered Croatia to make war, and there they were all slain by the Croats.   On Serbs ........  But when two brothers succeeded their father in the rule of Serbia, one of them, taking a moiety of the folk, claimed the protection of Heraclius, the emperor of the Romans, and the same emperor Heraclius received him and gave him a place in the province of Thessalonica to settle in, namely Serbia, which from that time has acquired this denomination. 'Serbs' in the tongue of the Romans is the word for 'slaves', whence the colloquial 'serbula' for menial shoes, and 'tzerboulianoi' for those who wear cheap, shoddy footgear. This name the Serbs acquired from their being slaves of the emperor of the Romans. Now, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. But when they had crossed the river Danube, they changed their minds and sent a request to the emperor Heraclius, through the military governor then governing Belgrade, that he would grant them other land to settle in.

I wish to express my utter apology for the poor standard of our tumble dryers that you recently have received. I assure you that the fault was not of the manufacturers, but of the transport company that we hire to deliver our products. The tumble dryers left our company in perfect condition, and therefore were not properly packaged into the lorries and were damaged in the journey. As for the colour schemes, we are to believe that the tumble dryers were being delivered along side some cans of paint and must have got mixed up along the way.  We will have a word with the delivery company to sort out the problem and so future deliveries should arrive in the high standard expected of our company.  In the meantime might we interest you in some exclusive discount vouchers on future orders. Find enclosed our brochure.  Your Sincerely      N Thorpe Complaints Manager   Ref.

I to am a very well known celebrity, I just in fact was almost a winner for a daytime Emmy award (but that's neither here nor there)  I think what the big confusion is about Wikipedia is that it is verifiable information, not what you WANT on your wikipedia article.  Meaning, awhile back your website sold tarot card readings via email, we can all see that looking at the cached version of it. Maybe you do not do that anymore but your company DID in fact do it. Therefore since Wikipedia is a historicaly piece of work, it should be listed. Maybe instead you could add in ``Used to.... but does not anymore``  I used to dance with Hula Hoops on stage. I do not anymore. But if a person put on my Wikipedia Article, ``Julianna Mauriello used to dance with hula hoops on stage`` then I could not mark that as non factual and write on wikipedia that it is not true. So for that reason, since I can see that your website USED to sell Tarot readings via email, I am going to revert it but also comment it to show that you no longer DO tarot card readings.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julianna_Rose_Mauriello   `", "4": "article", "5": "blocked", "1": 50438675, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 1111, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 1119, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 1999, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 2381, "3": 1.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 3176, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 1020, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 3792, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 911, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 609, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 877, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 3933, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 886, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 130, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 316, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 353, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 382, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 11, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 795, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 851, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 50438675, "2": 445, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.0, "1": 50461677, "2": -1, "3": 0.6}, "2": " :That's cool.

Im getting a book, Growing up Chicano...have you read it? How good is it? I want to get the entire Hispanic experience in me, not just the Puerto Rican-Caribbean Hispanic experience and to be honest if it was Growing up Bolivian or Spainard Id buy it too, but I cant wait til I read this book Growing up Chicano.

Wal-Mart does not spend as much on insurance as other companies.  The fact. Yes Wal-Mart spends less per work for health.  The Twist. What they forget to say is that Wal-Mart does not buy insurance at  all, it puts that money into a bank account, where it collects interest, it then contracts Blue Cross to admin the fund.   The reality. Wal-Mart gives better insurance than most other retailers.  Want to see for yourself go to your local walmart and get an assocate guide.  2. Wal-Mart does not supply as many with healthcare.  The fact. Yes on a percentage base Wal-Mart only 47% are covered.  The Twist. What critics don't tell you is that Wal-Mart offers Star Bridge health from day one, and that wal-mart has 1.6 million Workers with a larger turn over rate, so this leads to a lower percentage of works covered.  3. Wal-Mart has a high turn over rate.  The Fact. Wal-Mart does have a high turn over rate.  The Twist. Critics Site Wal-Mart as the reason, however most of people that leave walmart site customer related stress. And the area of walmart that has the highest turn over is also the largest pool of workers, cashiers. Plain and simple the customers run the cashiers out. And who can blame them think of all the people in the world you could not stand, and they deal with them all everyday.  4. Wal-Mart has more workers on state healthcare than any other company.  The Fact. Yes wal-mart does have more works on state healthcare.  The Twist. Critics argue that due to the number of workers on state healthcare is single handedly causing problems for many state healthcare,however what they forget to say is that Walmart pays 70 Billion dollars in federal taxes and nearly that again in state taxes and also generate billions of dollars in sales tax for each state with sales tax,which far out does the money spend buy the state on healthcare for wal-mart assocates. And many of the assocates that quilify for state aided healthcare also would quailify for welfare if they did not work for walmart. And would most likely be on both if they worked for a smaller ma and pa shop, that could not afford to supply any benefits.   5. Wal-mart buys large quantities from china  The Fact Yes walmart buys a lot from china.  The Twist Critics argue that Walmart alone is the primary reason for US jobs being exported, however what they fail to say is that walmart is only 8% of the use Retail market, and 70% of walmarts income if from food sales and 90% of walmarts food supply comes from local and national suppliers, like con-agra. When broken down walmart sends a mear penny to china out of ever transaction. something much larger than walmart is helping china out.   Now these are just 5 of the biggest twisted facts, there are many more out there, both good and bad for walmart, walmart does its share of fact twisting too. However I have seen almost no hard research here on any of the facts being relied on. I have alot of hard proof of lots of these twisted facts but I can not be the only one out looking for the twistes in the facts. And I also am not going to post any of the proofs until others start, because I want everyone here to start doing some research and finding some real reliable facts that we can bring this entry back to a good standing. But we must work together to do that, not against eachother.

No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.  Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.

As the result of an arbitration case, he posted these words on a talk page: ``Lou_franklin is banned from editing this article...  The user is not prevented from discussing or proposing changes on this talk page.``    Since it explicitly said ``The user is not prevented from discussing or proposing changes``, I did.  As a result he blocked me for 48 hours!  He apparently made a mistake posting the wording because he changed it to ``the user is prevented`` after he blocked me.  Obviously since the talk pages said I am ``not prevented from discussing or proposing changes``, it is not appropriate to ban me for doing so!  Other users (above) suggested to him that he ``ask for clarification at the relevant ArbCom page`` and ``I think it is advisable to ask clarification`` and ``since the template was misleading, the block should probably be lifted``, but he flatly refused saying ``there is nothing to clarify...  Specific rulings overrule a general template.``   I asked him to post a link to the Wikipedia policy that states that.  He could not provide one, and responded by saying ``you are rulelawyering``.  He said ``you should know better than to rely on a general template``.  When the 48 hour block was over, he blocked me again for a week!    This time he blocked for using the word ``homo`` on a talk page.  I didn't feel that the word ``homo`` was all that offensive.  A homo is ``someone who practices homosexuality`` (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=homo ), which is what we were talking about.  It comes from the Greek word which means ``same`` - as in same sex.  This admin is making up rules as he goes.  Once I am unblocked I will file a complaint against him, but since he still has me blocked I can't even do that.  I need intervention on two fronts: I need somebody to unblock me, and I need somebody to mentor John.  If an admin posts that it's OK for a user to add to the discussion, it's really not reasonable for the same admin to block the user for doing so.

If you have any questions please leave a message on my  page notifying me.  Thanks!     :Here is the text of the paragraph in question: ::The day of the week on which Jesus died is also in question.  Historically Friday has been the accepted day, since the Gospels record the death as being the day before the Sabbath, which the Hebrews celebrated on Saturday.  However, the gospels also assert that Jesus was dead for three days and three nights, and was resurrected on the first day of the week, Sunday.  Jesus died right before Passover, and Passover was a special holiday that would have created a ``Special Sabbath`` on whatever day of the week it fell upon.  More modern examinations show that probably Jesus died on Wednesday and the Passover was a special Sabbath the day after. :There is not a single source for this paragraph. First of all, could you please cite your sources. Next, while possibly a valid POV, the idea that Jesus died on a Wednesday is not mainstream or ``probable``. We need to clarify who exactly holds this POV and how prevelent it is. Next, it seems a little wordy and could possibly be reduced to one sentence: However, a minority of scholars theorize that Jesus was crucified on a Wednesday because the claim in the Gospels that Jesus died before the Sabbath could be referencing a so-called ``Special Sabbath`` of the Passover feast .-   :Re:  I agree. In my understanding (reading books of scholars, which I will not list here) the fact that Jesus died on a Friday is mostly accepted. What is open whether this was Nisan 14 o 15, as discussed recently. Precisely which verses state that he was dead for 3 days and nights? About the special sabbath: I am confused: usually if, Nisan 15, the first day of Pessach/Passover falls on a Sabbath, this Sabbath is called great Sabbath. (well more or less).   ::I don't believe the gospels say he was dead for 3 days and nights when giving a strict account; they might make a comparison between Jesus and Jonah, who was in the belly of a fish for 3 days and nights, or something close to that. The gospels do say that Jesus rose on the ``third day.`` If we count Friday as day 1, Saturday as day 2, that makes Sunday day 3, or the third day. I think someone would have to decide to give extra weight to the allusions to Jonah, and less to the ``rose on the third day`` accounts (and predictions) in the gospels, to come up with Jesus being dead for three days and nights.   :::Indeed, and most Christians believe that Jesus died on Friday afternoon and rose on early Sunday morning. That's actually less than 48 hours.     ::::Matthew 12:40 says ``for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.``  This seems to be another instance of Matthew shoe-horning old testament prophecies to prophesy Jesus.  In other parts of his own gospel, I believe that Matthew indicates (like Mark, his source for the Passion Narrative) that Jesus died on Friday.  At any rate, Wednesday wouldn't be three nights - it'd be at least four nights - Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night.  Thursday would presumably be the way to get to three days and three nights.  `", "4": "article", "5": "random", "1": 53104133, "3": true, "6": [{"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 520, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 1006, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 570, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 409, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 1678, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 399, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 385, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 229, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 205, "3": 0.0}, {"4": 0.0, "1": 53104133, "2": 83, "3": 0.0}]}, {"7": {"4": 0.55, "1": 53114437, "2": -1, "3": -1.15}, "2": "  == I think this sick man should be put to death ==  ...but that's just my opinion.

If families start communicating with their children, helping their children, and supporting the things their children accomplish, there will be a smaller amount of gang members. I say this because most gang members are in search of love and support. Things that they are not receiving within the realms of their own home. Therefore that's why they go out and join gangs.   P.S.
