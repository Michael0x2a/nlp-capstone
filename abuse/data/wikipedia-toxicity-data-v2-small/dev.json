[{"1": 35367, "2": "`:In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.  What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw  === From Interpreted Language/Talk ===   :some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime  Could you elaborate ? Taw  Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15  You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw  : I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley  === Old Interpreted Language article ===  An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.  It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either ``interpreted`` or ``compiled``, because most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime but behave as if they were interpreted. Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled). Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.  An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.   Is Java interpreted, or what?   The Java programming language article says:  :``The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.``   The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC  Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an ``eval`` statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt  Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of ``compiling``. It is used in two distinct meanings, as in: # compiled to machine code (or assembly) # compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation  I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way ``compiled``. In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all ``compile`` source to some form of internal representation.  Quote from FOLDOC:      Compiler       A program that converts another program      from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to      {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output      {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine      language} by a separate {assembler}.      ...  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1408, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 728, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 472, "ri": 35367, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 162, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 56, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1430, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1507, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3076, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1781, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2462, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 35367, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 37675, "2": "`- This is not ``creative``.  Those are the dictionary definitions of the terms ``insurance`` and ``ensurance`` as properly applied to ``destruction``.

The sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.  If that's my fault, fine, I can fix that to explain.  But ther'es nothing ``personal`` or ``creative`` about it.  I'm tired of arguing with you.  Re: the other article, ``multi-party`` turns up plenty, and there is more use of ``mutually`` than ``mutual``.  If I were to apply your standard I'd be moving ``Mutual Assured Destruction`` to ``talk`` for not appealing to a Reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness, and for dropping the ``ly``.  There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like ``peace movement`` or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.    If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks ``eye for an eye`` describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?  Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.  This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.  If someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.  If this is a history book, fine, it's a history book.

Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise.

But I can't help if someone try to suit every single article to his own fashion. You just throw out everything that does not fit to your personal view. Try to edit articles more for the reader and not for yourself. What is wrong if one sentence is not quite adequate and explicit. On the other hand I am doing my best to compose one article from the scratch and then you come and you 'ruin' almost my whole work. Who is doing fruitless work here? You're obviously to deep in the math and you can't see out anymore. Try to read one original work from an original mathematician, please. If you would have a chance, you would probably change even Gauss' work. Remember on what he had written about the estimation of the number of primes and such. :(2) I'll try to fix the table, that bothers you so much. (Just give me some time). :(3) Don't call me Rasta if you're not shure what that means or if you think I am that, if I bear similar cyber nickname, and so on ) :(4) The symbol |. Sometimes you like and sometimes you don't. For instance it is more clear if we write, once we have agreed what | means, 3 | 9, than 3 divides 9. You have once said that any symbol in fact does not have much sence in math so here we go... :(5) What is wrong with M\u00f6bius function here or elsewhere. When I make a table, it is clear after that what values are, but try to 'calculate' its values from your mind. I gave the function to depict further on the whole subject. It is pointless; there is no connection that needs to be mentioned. That is you opinion, I guess. Everything is important in math, specially in a number theory. If I wouldn't use M\u00f6bius function I wouln't be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700. I guess here \u03bc(n) is 'more' important than other arithmetic functions. That's my opinion. Furthermore, anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value, since all they have to do is to count the prime factors, which are already given in the table. Yes, that is true. But many readers do not know at first what \u03bc(n) means and shows. Simply as that. :(6) I am not your student out there somewhere so we have to work for this project. You correct me and I correct you if and only if I can. I am pretty tired of writting articles which envolve math, but I like math very much. And because you know something from the math, you can give your knowledge to others and not just fixing things all around as it is going for one math test. My teachers are mathematicians themselves. Only you change these articles so much, no one else. So I can't figure that they do not understand what is written in them.

To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book ``The Real Split In The International`` could just as well be called the ``fundamental split`` if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both.  ::Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a ``revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation`` thing going on).  ::In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting.  ::As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.       `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 915, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 99, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 261, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 198, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 502, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 848, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 404, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 887, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 265, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 884, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 1074095, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "random"}, {"1": 1083879, "2": "Hello there Harris7, welcome to Wikipedia!

It may be better for all if you turn your efforts to more fruitful and productive entries, instead of continually trying to add ``con`` to this ``pro`` entry. It was recently pointed out to me that some of my editions to the big bang entry were inappropriate, because an entry for a subject is the place to support the subject, not to tear it down. The suggestion was made to me that I move my proposed editions to where they would be appropriate, in ``non-standard cosmology`` entries. I now make this suggestion to you. If you seek to criticize iridology, you should not do it in the entry meant to explain and support iridology. Perhaps you can make an entry titled ``non-standard iridology`` or maybe even ``fringe theories about iridology`` if you want to challenge the mainstream iridologists. Just a suggestion, I hope it will help you as much as it helped me. -  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2162, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2155, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2122, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2115, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 56, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2048, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1959, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 359, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1514, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 989, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 2457387, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 2482777, "2": "Ed Poor, *East Sea is a local name both in South Korea and Vietnam.

The following appears on Blue Ball but is more efficient to discuss here: :``Blue balls`` is a modern slang term for a minor cramping men may get in the groin after they are sexually stimulated for a prolonged period but do not ejaculate.  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is ``a painful spasmodic muscular contraction``, and the groin does have muscles.  But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes ``congestion``, which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the ``pain and tenderness`` of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.)  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)  Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier ``release semen`` (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply ``release``), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain ``release``, or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2410, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 882, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2262, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3374, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3371, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3359, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3351, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3328, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2912, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2525, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 1.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 2795559, "tg": 0.3}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 2811467, "2": "ll let others prosify. -rj", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3764, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3878, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3245, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3302, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2099, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3673, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 678, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 715, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3211, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2429, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 2811467, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 2882541, "2": "  Is there any interest in a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject|WikiProject] on Catholicism?

However, the problem I still have with it is that the way the various POVs are presented implies that the fate of the peace process depends on the goodwill of the Palestinians, which appears uncertain, and hence Israel is the victim of their apparent duplicity. Let's be real: Israel is the occupying force here and has far, far greater military might (not to speak of economic power). The Palestinians are virtually mendicants. Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for ``the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea`` without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads.   :Your anti-Israel political rant is of no help here.

I would like to see the material in this article merged back into the parent article under the section ``The Peace Process``.

You can learn more on the how to edit page. The naming conventions and manual of style pages are also useful. Feel free to experiment at the Wikipedia:Sandbox.

Click on ``hide minor edits`` first if you want a count of only non-minor edits.   :I hope mav doesn't count his edits this way!

In the references there (look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics) you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras. And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory): [x,y,z]=R(x,y)z. This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity is missing, but a reference to the bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra. Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras). All this shows, that we do not yet understand this curvature space completely. Especially the gravitational wave aspect needs clarification.

I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:  ::It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.  : That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.  : Let me explain what I mean with my ``intuitiveness`` concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply ``antigravity`` to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's ``beating`` some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to ``beat`` as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (``then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right...``) and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  `", "6": [{"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1215, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 624, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3242, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2369, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 623, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2242, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2798, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3548, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2801, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1677, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.8, "wi": -1, "ri": 3609048, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 3613119, "2": "  :No, it's good.

On the plus side it is clear. On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.) Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information. My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person): An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?  Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)? Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece. LOTS of non-classical-specialists could whistle the 3rd movt tune while Wynton was still at school! ) I'm sorry to do this to you as you now won't have a chance to argue with me, but it's the best I can manage right now.

The article can't decide whether it's talking about a single-round Nash equilibrium, or the Nash equilibrium of a repeated game.  It talks about repetition, and a threatened ``retaliation`` the Predictor, but it describes an equilibrium which doesn't need retaliation or a repeated game at all.  The equilibrium {choose both boxes, predict both boxes} is quite stable for the single-round game, and is the only Nash equilibrium.  Both players choosing ``one box`` is also a Nash equilibrium for the repeated game.  However, when we have a repeated game, another Nash equilibrium is possible.  If the Predictor adopts a strategy ``always choose one box unless the Chooser chose two boxes last round`` then the Chooser can also always choose one box and have no incentive to deviate.  Deviating would net an extra 1,000 for that round, but would cap the maximum payoff at 1,000 in the next round, where it would have been 1,000,000.  Hence, the deviation is discouraged and the equilibrium is stable.  The real question is, is any of this germane to the article's topic?

Croatian Left often portrays this culture as ``primitive`` and ``rural`` (even ``fashist``) being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, ``performed`` on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.   Another ``apostle`` of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergovi\u0107 - refers to his political opponents on the Right as ``gusle players``.   Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all \u0161tokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljevi\u0107, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorovi\u0107's book ``Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje``, 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatovi\u0107, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.    Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska \u2013 was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107 Mio\u0161i\u0107 (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Ka\u010di\u0107's work, Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Ka\u010di\u0107 in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.    In addition to Ka\u010di\u0107, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Juri\u0161i\u0107 (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banovi\u0107), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosovi\u0107-Kudri\u0107 (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banovi\u0107 \u2013 Trli\u0161 (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound.   Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar.   The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ``Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West`` that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)  This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osrede\u010dki: \u201cHrvatske narodne juna\u010dke pjesme\u201d, \u017deljezno-Be\u010d, p. 9)  Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region.   Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1410, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1288, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1441, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1921, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1934, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1191, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 528, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 2187, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2279, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2879, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 6006995, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 6029021, "2": "`  I am ``guilty`` of nothing.

Many kinds of insurance are designed not to protect you from error, but from ``acts of God``, such as fires and floods. Unless you mean to call God and/or ``the Universe`` a source of ``error``. Insurance protects you from many things that are not error, including chance and intentional malice.  :Errors occur naturally, for example, an error in the replication of genetic material will result in a mutation, probably an unfavorable one.   Removed. Not NPOV. Whether errors occur ``naturally`` is entirely a matter of philosophical perspective. There is certainly a perspective from which anything natural is, by definition, free of error. In the case of genetics, you can only regard mutation as an ``error`` if you take as given that nature ``wants`` its replication processes to be exact replication processes.  :Irrespectively of their inevitability, at law the fiction is maintained that an error is a wrong, negligence, a tort, for which anyone who suffers damage as the result thereof must be compensated by the perpetrator.

See:  The '''Great Purge''' is the name given to the events of the late [[1930s]] in the [[Soviet Union]], when millions of people were arrested, about one million executed, and an estimated 12 million to sent to labour camps.  According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as ``anti-Soviet elements`` among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (``Yezhov storm``). However, the purge was carried out on the orders of Stalin himself.  It is rather obvious that you do not have a copy of this standard reference work available or choose not to refer to it. Furthermore you seem to be unfamiliar with generally accepted knowledge with respect to this area. I believe it is a reasonable expectation that you familiarize yourself with the subjects you chose to edit on and be able to consult standard reference works and understand them. Could you please remedy this situation. As it stands now you are wasting everyone's time.

Energy.  To simply categorize physics as ``the study of everything`` is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain ``bulk`` properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.`", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1335, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2928, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1141, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1539, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2153, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3927, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3824, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4049, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4048, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4055, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 6633594, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "random"}, {"1": 6656557, "2": "`::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word.

I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   |  07:16, Jan 4,`", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3634, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3957, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2008, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2766, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3188, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4141, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3437, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3986, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3362, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3633, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 9095438, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 9111928, "2": "` :OK I think I've done it right - please let me know if I haven't.

Stirling, you might want to check the logs to see how Wigdor was previously removed from the article.  Wigdor is nothing but an emerging artist who thinks he's the next Salvador Dali.

Why would he delete this post, I wonder:  If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.      It wasn't long ago that all references to ``Keith Wigdor`` were removed from this ``surrealism`` article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.     It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this ``surrealism`` article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.  For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 332, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2765, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2410, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1985, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1901, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1694, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1180, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1172, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3825, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 364, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 9339988, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 9368700, "2": "` ::::::::::Again, there was no ``as if`` in GTBacchus's statement, nor any ``as if`` equivalent.

But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.  As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for ``Australian Jews`` in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population.

It doesn't matter if Byrd was a Kleagle 60 years ago or 50 years ago or if was a Kleagle in 2001 when he was talking about ``White N****.``  The fact that he was a Kleagle is the probably one of the most important aspects of his whole career.  He even admits that himself when he tells other potential Kleagles not to become Kleagles because the whole Kleagle thingeven if you are like Byrd and think the Kleagle thing is coolwill hurt you because guys like me (the supposedly UNserious conservative) will remind him of his Kleagle days every chance that I get.  Byrd was a Kleagle and that is one of the most important aspects of his whole career.  He even admits the fact that his Kleagle-ness has held him back to bigger and better things.  And don't argue that he didn't want bigger and better things than to be the head Kleagle from West Virginia.  He did run for the Presidency and the whole Kleagle surely couldn't have helped.

You could have Written ``Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west``. Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered  Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  ``human-rights situation`` which you hope anyone can interpret as anything.  Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?  revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only ``a situation``. A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.  Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen! Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance?   I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to  disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there must be some divine logic here beyond my rationality. Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then? Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLY that means not ONLY the palestinians!   Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds? if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes  important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as ``Human rights situation``?   and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all the henceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps? remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men. they might cause something to your ``Human rights situation`` otherwise.   And this pargraph:   an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction  do you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!   And this,  ``Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.``  Are you hinting that this sentence: ``While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians``  is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are ther any references of this, or just hearsay?  Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it! (never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?)

I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 52, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 596, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2673, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 659, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1046, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1084, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1520, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2884, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2690, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2879, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 10470096, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 10471642, "2": "  :I am sorry that your edits were removed from the article.

And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.``  These passages contradict one another.  The first states man and woman being created together.  The second two have Adam being created first, followed by Eve.  If a person believes that the Bible is the word of God then both are correct.  So, to make them both correct there has to be a first woman followed by Eve.  Which is how the idea of Lilith came about - filling in the gaps to make both versions true.

As for the substance of the issue:  1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that ``many historians concede`` on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.  2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas.   3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about ``the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union.`` Where does he get this info?  The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once. Now, I laid out my reasons and will wait for some days for comments rather than reverting this changes right now.

Scott, i think that is evidence that you still just don't get it.  this has nothing to do with string theory.  string theory is non-sequitur.  i hardly understand string theory (really, just the pop stuff Brian Greene puts on Nova), but i fully understand the argument that, in reality, the only physical quantities that we measure, that we perceive, that make any difference to anything that involves us as human beings (or E.T. beings, for that matter) are dimensionless quantities.  when something changes that affects us, ultimately it's a dimensionless measure, usually the ratio of like dimensioned quantities.  we always measure a dimensionful quantity against another like dimensioned quantity.  ::::if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.

Rather than delete material though, we should probably add to it, so we should think about writing a section about culture from an anthropological perspective. There might be material in Culture that would help.     ==Unclear sections== I've removed these two paragraphs from the article as they were unclear and unreferenced. If they're to go back in, they'll need references and a rewrite. I'd have rewritten them myself, but I don't know what the first is trying to say, and the second as it stands is false, plus the Pascal quote, if it is a quote, needs a citation, and should be in the Emotions section.     The rules of scientific classification require a description of an individual specimen of the species. In 1993, Robert Bakker formally described the skull of paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in an attempt to make Cope the type specimen for Homo sapiens. Despite current requirements that the specimen be available to the describing scientist (Cope was born in 1840 and the scientist who described and published Homo sapiens, Carolus Linnaeus, did so in 1758), it is unclear as to the lack of validity of Bakker's publication and many consider Cope to be the type specimen.  The mental ability of humans and their intelligence make them, according to Pascal, the most sad creatures of all animals. The ability to have feelings, such as sadness or happiness, distinguish them from the other organisms, even if this assertion can be hardly proved with animal tests. Humans' existence, according to most philosophers, configures itself as the search of happiness.  ==References== We have a short list of references in the References section, but with no indication in the text which points they were sources for; and the inline references we do have are not listed under References. I can fix the latter but not the former. Would whoever added these please say which section each of them was used as a reference for? Otherwise I'll move them to Further reading.

Some of the categories you emptied have been around for six months at least, such as British botanists, so it wasn't just an anon (who was most likely  logged out, as the software is wont to do). Although I understand that you personally think nationality is unimportant, that is just your POV; for a high-school teacher in New Zealand or Brazil looking up homegrown botanists for the class to write about, that is quite relevant, and nearly impossible to find out without the subcategories. In any case, you're setting yourself against the hundreds of editors who have built Category:Nationalities by occupation and Category:People by nationality and their thousands of subcategories. Either botanists are fundamentally different from other kinds of people (which could be argued I suppose -) ), or all these other editors are mistaken, in which case you should convince them of their wrongness first before unilaterally emptying out the category. But given that Category:American actors alone has some 3,000 names, I don't think you're going to get much of a favorable hearing! If you want to argue that the botanists is still too small to be subdivided, that's plausible, but your argument seems to be that the category shouldn't be subdivided no matter how large it gets. Just as you expect other people to defer to your knowledge in matters arboreal, you should respect those who are more knowledgeable about information organization.  `` :::Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3568, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3561, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 250, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1117, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1387, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3114, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3160, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2247, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3559, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3569, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 11845450, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 11907717, "2": "  ::Great.

If you double the table at each step, then for a given n the rehashing will have cost at most 1 + 2 + ... + n/4 + n/2 + n which is strictly less then 2*n, thus the O(n) complexity. The same holds for any exponential growth, like increasing table size by 25% which would be more sensible for very large tables as you want to avoid large jumps in memory use for a very small variation of the input size.

The whole purpose of a stub is to act as an invitation to create an article.  Frequently, it is difficult to tell whether the subject is encyclopedic.  I have seen many good articles start as stubs.  For example, a stub may start as ``John Q. Unknown was an American politician`` and it may turn out that he was a Territorial governor, U.S. Senator and later president of a well known college.  Unless the subject of a stub is very well known, it is a rare stub that gives enough detail to know immediately whether the subject has the potential to become encylcopedic. : You may have already seen these, but I would refer you to Wikipedia:Stub and Wikipedia:Deletion policy. The deletion policy states that among the problems which do not require deletion are a stub with potential (which should be expanded) or a minor branch of a subject that doesn't deserve its own article (which should be merged, with a redirect to the new location).    `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3704, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3637, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3507, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2716, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1910, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1657, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 492, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 372, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3714, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3439, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 14224035, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 14232800, "2": "  :AFAIK they were not granted full independence - from some declassified State Department memos I was looking at, when Eric Williams tried to force the US to withdraw from its bases in Trinidad the British government re-assured the US that if Williams became too extreme in his demands they (the UK) could remove him from power.

Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families.

July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to ``kiboze``). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology.   James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.  Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.  Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.

Thank you.      == re: VfD bot assistant == When you get to the actual closing process, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated.  So many of the decisions require multiple steps.  But I may not be the right person to ask.  I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions.  I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of ``simple`` decisions.  I'll give it some thought, though.    Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread?  If so, what parameters would have to be fed in?  How complex would it be to initiate the bot?  Would it be a different bot for ``keep`` decisions vs ``delete`` decisions?  The essential steps for a ``keep`` decision are: # Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}}) # Remove the VfD header from the page (which ''usually'' follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together # Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion.  I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.  If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple ``keep`` decision might be automatable with a single parameter.  ``Keep as merge``, ``transwiki``, etc. would still require extra steps.  The essential steps for a ``delete`` decision are: # Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order # Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed) # Sometimes, check ``what links here`` and move or delete all those links # Delete the page  I'm not sure I see how to automate that process.  There are too many variables.  I'll keep chewing on it, though.

This view is not common even among practicing analysts, who in large part recognise that the mind is a function of the brain, so that any full theory of the psyche needs to refer to the brain.  An excellent review of this is Kandel ER (1999) ``Biology and the future of psychoanalysis``, Am.J.Psychiat 156:505.  Psychoanalytic thinking is inseparably bound also to clinical treatment of patients.  Some purists claim that achieving insight is the only goal of psychoanalysis; but health insurers generally require more concrete goals such as reduced mental illness or increased time at work.  Both of these clinical perspectives assume that the effect on actual patients is important  so they should be included in this article.  An excellent review of the clinical benefits of psychoanalysis is Fonagy, Roth & Higgitt (2005), Bull.Menninger Clinic 69(1):1-58.  This article would not be complete without consideration of substantial attacks on psychoanalysis and its theory, which have reshaped psychiatric practice in the UK and USA over the past 20-30 years.  These attacks can be classified as empirical (Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002); financial (Detre & McDonald 1997); theoretical (Meehl 1998 calculates that there are many psychoanalytical explanations possible for any single clinical problem); and circumstantial (e.g. past failures with respect to homosexuality and childhood abuse, and the antipathy of many analysts to quantitative research:  Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002).  Psychoanalytic theorists may have over-reached themselves in attempting to account for all troublesome psychic phenomena.  However, their concerted efforts to address more circumscribed areas have produced widely acknowledged, influential advances in the areas of defense mechanisms, attachment, the unconscious, transference and counter-transference, and the treatment of borderline personalities, among others.  Each of these advances has been accompanied by individual theories.  ==Suggestions for the peer-review== The article should not require a paragraph to describe what it is about; instead, its scope should simply be theories to do with psychoanalysis.  It should include subsections on the question of whether (and how) psychoanalysis can be studied objectively, whether it is disproveable in whole or part (and whether this matters), the informal ``theory`` of the manners in which analysis can be conducted (e.g. bare room unlike Freud; methods of interpretation), and the relationships with behavioural, cognitive, and psychiatric theories.  It would be useful to have an explanation of why psychoanalysis has resisted decline so much more successfully in France than in anglophone countries.  Rather than complicated sentences with complicated words, we should be treated to simple descriptions of the differences between Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian thinking.  Possibly in lists if that helps to simplify the sentences.`", "6": [{"ts": 2.0, "wi": 187, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 311, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1017, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1401, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1446, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1489, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1515, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1523, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 342, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 864, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 14897496, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 14930859, "2": "` ::In the English language: An electric bass could mean any electrified bass instrument: electric bass guitar, electric double bass...  ::I'd say Vunzmstr is trying to improve the naming accuracy.

The Tangut did not speak Chinese, they spoke their own language. The official name of their land in their own language has been written about by Ksenia Kepping and is available on a link from the Tangut Language page. In no case was Xia there autonym. It was something like Minyag which is waht they are called in Tibetan.   In general I have a big chip on my sholder about Sinologists becomming confucian literati. The Yuan, and Qing were no more Chinese than I am. To use Chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval Chinese worldview. While now it is indeed true that the PRC owns a big chunk of Asia how much of it is actually historically China?  The Jurchen's, Kitans, Tangut, Mongols, Tibetans, Nanchao, Azha (T\u00fcy\u00fch\u00fcn) were their own countries with their own languages and customs. Tangut history is relevant to Chinese history in the way that French history is relevant to English history, but also vice versa.   To have a thing on the article saying 'this article is part of the section Chinese History' reinforces the view that the Tangut's don't deserve their own history.   There is a sociological fact about Western academia that Sinology is big and well funded, while Tangutology, Nanchaology, Kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant.

Okay from the top: 1) My info on the GLAAD awards and the EISNER Nominations came from Winick\u2019s website. BUT is that\u2019s not good enough\u2026  2)  I did a quick GOOGLE ( WINICK and GLAAD AWARDS) and found various articles to that effect. Here\u2019s one that mention awards from 2001 & 2002  http://www.psicofxp.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-105929.html  here\u2019s the link to the GLAAD awards in 2003 ( they don\u2019t archive back further then that)  http://www.glaad.org/media/release_detail.php?id=3393&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43   and a photo from 2003  http://www.glaad.org/publications/resource_doc_detail.php?id=3396&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43  3) the Eisners was more difficult because were too many sites and not a definitive archive. I punched in ``Winick and Eisner awards`` into GOOGLE and got over 500 hits. Some mention his nominations in articles ABOUT him, some site specific years in articles ABOUT the Eisner nominations. It doesn\u2019t look like his website is lying\u2026  Now, onto some specific comments:  ``Furthermore, I saw the article more pro-gay than anti-gay. I think the previous version of the article attempts to put Judd in a rather ``heroic`` role by saying that he pushed boundaries and was willing to shrug off industry standards to get his point across. It may have had a POV issue, but I don't think that it was homophobic. I would be careful about throwing that word around, being that you are suggesting unbiased claims. Practice what you preach, and all that.``  Forgive me jumping the gun on mentioning ``homophobia``, but the article REALLY didn\u2019t read as positive or heroic when:  1) It focussed  \u2013almost ENTIRELY\u2014on the issue of Winick writing about gays.   2)Tossed some interpretation that he made Robin( of Batman and Robin) into a crossdresser ( which he didn\u2019t. it was JOKE. It\u2019d be like accusing MONTY PYTHON of promoting `` lifestyle choices`` by having them dress as women all the time)  3)Adding/allowing an erroneous comment from another comic book creator. (MIKE Miller, later changed into the a false statement by FRANK Miller)  4) And lastly, make mention of `` gay groups`` who took issue with, disagreed with, etc, Mr. Winick\u2019s portrayal of gays. No evidence t that fact was given and it appears that the VAST majority of the gay community doesn\u2019t have a problem with him.  All of THIS, didn\u2019t really come off as an endorsement, a slap on the back, or in much of ANY way that he was being applauded for making a stand.   ``I would add two points: (1) The article should definitely include some discussion, albeit NPOV, of Winick's penchant for gay characters. He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn't made a secret of that, either. The article should be neutral, but that fact is a critical facet of Winick's career. ``  I don\u2019t agree. It COVERS the issue already. You\u2019re asking for an opinion. I\u2019ve been told, several times, that THAT isn\u2019t the point of this site.  Also, ``Winick's penchant for gay characters``. Why JUST talk about gays? I mean, is it because  he get PRESS about them?  He\u2019s got LOTS of other people in his comics. But if you\u2019re mentioning GAYS because it\u2019s gotten media coverage, then THAT is already IN the article. No need to expand on it.  ``He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn't made a secret of that, either.``  1) What\u2019s all this stuff about YOUNG readers? Comics, and even his book were aimed at ALL readers? Are you trying to slide in a sideways comment that Winick is targeting children? And secondly, in the 3 times I\u2019ve heard Winick talk about this subject he always comes back to the point that he includes ALL types of people in his stories. Diversity is the goal.  In general you seem VERY intent on shining a different light on this issue. One that falls into opinion and editorializing.  The facts are covered. It\u2019s there. It\u2019s done.   (2) He is not considered ``one of the top writers`` in comics. Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Jeph Loeb...there are plenty of names at the top, but Winick's has never been among them. I've never read a claim otherwise, either  so if this article is going to allege Winick's prominence, you'd better include some sort of citation.   Well, 1) It doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s the MOST prominent writer in comics like a Frank  Miller, Neil Gaiman,  Grant Morrison or an Alan Moore. It\u2019s says ONE of the top writers.

Much more often the term ``ethnic cleansing`` was used, and the rest of the sentence you cut from the article, all of which is verifiable, ``and all those hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes, and all those little girls were raped, and all those little boys were murdered,`` describes ethnic cleansing perfectly.  Are the few uses of the word 'genocide' indicative of the case made by the Clinton administration, or were the much more frequent references to ethnic cleansing the pillar of the argument?  I would say it was certainly the latter, but because he merely uttered the term genocide, proving my point would be a book-length endeavor.

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.  The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on \u201cThe makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking\u201d  Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, M\u00e5rten Lindst\u00e5hl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.  When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.  In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).  In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.  During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.  Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.   The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Sm\u00e5 Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.  Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.   Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer months.   The gardens were created by Axel\u2019s wife Hilda on the promontories and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

I do know it needed editing, revising, expanding, and to be ``brought up to the times.`` Just something interesting to think about.  ALLAH, the Arabic name used by Moslems of all nationalities for the one true God. It is compounded of al, the definite article, and ilah, meaning a god.  The same word is found in Hebrew and Aramaic as well as in ancient Arabic (Sabaean).  The meaning of the root from which it is derived is very doubtful; cf.  Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 82, and the Oxford Hebrew and English Lexicon, pp. 61 ff.  == 2002 ==  A previous version of the ``Allah`` article included the following: ``Allah`` was also the proper name for the pre-Islamic god of the moon and travel worshiped by nomadic Arabic tribes. The name and has no femminine or plural forms. Allah was considered to be the ancestor and leader of the other gods, such as the goddesses al-Lat? and Man'at?  Anybody know why was this removed?  It seems that the moon god theory is heavily disputed and has limited support. It appears to be based on the poor quality work of only one man (Robert Mory) in the last 10 years.  Well, insofar as 'Allah' doubles as the name 'God' in Arabic we're up against the problem solved in English by capitalization, capital G for the monotheistic god of the Jews and Christians (who prefers that we NOT use his first name) versus the gods with a small G. ``Allah`` was undoubtedly used about all SORTS of deities, and that's where the Moon-deity argument falls down.  And watch out about publishing the female-trinity bit  isn't that what got Salman Rushdie in trouble? Michael Tinkler.  I authored the paragraph about the moon-god theory. I read about this in ``Islam``  by Jamal J. Elias, a Muslim author. The book is an intorduction to Islam from the POV of a liberal Muslim scholar. As Elias is Associate Professor of Religion at Amherst College, Massachusetts, and he writes on this theory as if it were fact, it seems there is more to this picture than the ``poor`` work of one scholar. Therefore, I have restored the paragrah, with a note on it's contoversy.  I also authored the bit about Yahweh that was taken out. Critism accepeted, it belongs in its own article. So i have put it in Yahweh.  -    It does seem true that Allah was the name of a moon god - and that Mohammed's father had allah as part of his name. But the name does have a feminine form - al Lat. It is not clear the connection of the moon god to the Muslim god.  Ok, first of all: Allah does simply mean ``the god``, rather equivalent to our capitalized ``God``. Hence, any major god (like this moon god, apparently) would have very likely been called ``God``. I did some [admittely Internet-based] research on this topic just now, and clarified a few things in the actual text. Let me know how it reads now.  Here's a question. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, so its articles should be about topics, not words per se. So is the ``Allah`` article the appropriate place to provide a discussion of the Islamic concept of God? My initial thought would be yes.  But Arabic-speaking Christians would use the word to refer to the Christian God. Does that complicate the issue? Maybe. But one might argue that the wikipedia is in English (this one at least), and in English the word ``Allah`` is generally used to refer to God specifically with reference to Islam. Right? So the discussion of the Islamic concept of God should be under ``Allah``. Does this make sense? Anyone disagree?  Another question - Do Muslims take Allah to be the personal name for God or just the Arabic language word meaning God. This could be tricky since by way of comparison some Christians take Yahweh to be the personal name of God while others see it as just another description ``I am what I am`` (If there is only one of a class, i.e. one God, why would he need a personal name?)  Well. In the listing I have that is based on Hadith (the teaching tradition of Islam), Allah is listed as the first name among the 99 names.

If I could find out which bits to merge, I'd be very grateful for feedback! -    == That was a pretty horrible thing you said you know. ==  Did you actually bother to investigate CheeseDreams? did you check her ArbCom cases? Did you check how she deliberately and spitefully vandalised my user page? Did you bother to read any of the things I wrote? Where do you get off saying I enjoyed having CheeseDreams banned? I didn't do that: CD did that via her editing practices and disruption of Wikipedia. -    :Say what?! Look mate, I'm disputing the article, not CheeseDreams. The article is an essay written from an assumption (and in fact pretty much stated as ``fact``) that Jesus was the ``new sycretism``. This is, to put it frankly, quite far from the truth and though the info should be stated that such and such stated such and such, there should not be an entire article, especially one like CheeseDreams created. Why do you think I'm not opposing that a merge be done? Sheesh. You'd think I'm trying to destroy CheeseDreams life works or something. -    ::I would NPOV the article if I could. I can't. Why? Because the material isn't reference properly. Incidently, don't hold your breath for CheeseDreams to come back. She posted her password to a known trolls page and forced another admin to log in to her account quickly and change the password. She no longer has access to her account! In fact, we found 5 verified sock puppets of CheeseDreams (all with the same password) and she no longer has access to these accounts. You might want to note that I did start adding material: I have created an article The Two Babylons, which I encourage you to help me make more complete (I've only done the first two sections - and not even that). In the process I edited the article to clear up some misconceptions of CheeseDreams (like for instance she called Alexander Hislop a ``scholar``, which he most certainly wasn't).  ::However, I'm not sure how much time I have for you. I'm a little confused personally. The other day I was accused by a Stormfront member of being a traitor to the white race and/or a Jew, however today you tell me I'm a Nazi. Would you people please make up your minds? I'm getting mighty confused. -    = Personal attacks = I mentioned it before, now I'll say it here.

You must also elaborate on the pistols to be used, otherwise I will assume any caliber semi-automatic is permissable. As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable. I must commend you on selecting a cowardly weapon which greatly complicates the relatively straightforward process of an at-seas duel, you perfidious poltroon. Should you miraculously acquire vertabrae between now and the chosen date, I will gladly agree to a change in weapons, especially to epees. The time is acceptable to me. Please note that duels cannot take place within the jurisdiction of Canada, and therefore must take place at least 200 nautical miles (not standard miles) from the continental margin, to avoid breaking laws which expressly forbid dueling.   I await the duel eagerly.

Walker (BYU Professor of History),  ::::::Richard E. Turley Jr. (managing director of the Family and Church History Department of the Church), and Glen M. Leonard (director of the Church's Museum of Church History and Art).   ::::::The three were granted access to documents in the LDS Church archives. According to Turley, a file in the archives confirms that Lee was acting on his own. The file included the notes of a Mormon historian who, at the request of Church leaders, conducted a confidential investigation of the massacre in 1892. Turley said, ``There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.``  ::::::While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that ``Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . . Unfortunately, the militia and church leaders of Iron County made different decisions, and their acts demand the strongest condemnation . . . Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.``  ::::::The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is ``not a Church commission``; ``The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs.`` Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. ``Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,`` Turley said, adding that the authors will ``present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.``  ::::::The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books.

First of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of  irritation. I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the ``process`` of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims. 1. I sometimes find a ``You have a message waiting`` notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won't be visible to the world  e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn't want posted here? 2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB. Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica  I don't know how you folks access EB, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides ``teaser`` articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441 We have never been EB ``trial`` members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct? 3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use ``dummy`` accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, ``Oh yeah? Well, prove it!```` I have no idea what sort of ``proof`` one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might ``prove it.`` If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her. 4. As for ``my article,`` I was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have. 5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same ``new posting`` info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings. 6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the ``credit`` for our efforts. However, given the recent unpleasant incidents we've encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, I'm sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment. 7. I'll have to check into templates. I suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why using forms can be so dangerous.  `", "6": [{"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1604, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3374, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3371, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2878, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1656, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1686, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3299, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2409, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 194, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2863, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 1.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 18764566, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18766627, "2": "Management [people] changes as a resust of the Lockheed/Martin Merger", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1832, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1809, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1799, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1786, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1780, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1743, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1740, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1585, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 635, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 372, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 18766627, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18773267, "2": "  You have been temporarily blocked from editing for vandalism of Wikipedia.

I count many editors here as friends, but I feel as though our association has an added depth to it (perhaps because we've met in person...perhaps because we so often find each other saying what we would have said)  it's hard to tell you how glad I am to have your respect and your encouragement.  It's been a good thing to take a couple of months off and breathe the outside air a bit, and it's been especially nice (forgive my selfishness, if you will) to know that I can do that and trust that you (and a few other trusted souls) will fight the fires I had run out of energy to do anything about.  You really do exceptional work.  If someday there is a book that seeks to explain Wikipedia's exceptional growth, and remarkable stability in light of the ebb and flow of editors, let it reserve at least one chapter for you.  Thanks also for dealing with Wik and Quagga (I swear, I'm back one day and I stumble into that edit war...I almost screamed and logged out...of all the people I did _not_ want to deal with...) and the Shnorrer piece.  I've tried to get a dialogue going on the article's talk page, because clearly there isn't a consensus about exactly how the article should be left.  Maybe you'll join me there when you have time.  Finally, a long time ago you emailed me an invitation, which I very ungraciously never replied to.  I am very sorry about that.  It came, of course, at the wrong time of year for me, given the twin pressures of work and Wikistress, but it was wrong of me not to at least acknowledge your note, and I hope you will forgive the offense.  If you would like to reopen the invite, please email me and let me know.  Lastly...I'd like to give you a barnstar (I gave UC one because I realized how much I admire and rely on him for the work he does), but I just can't.  Not because you're undeserving (good heavens, no), but because I feel as though it would be a little too much like you receiving an award simply for being a good friend, and I'd rather not tarnish the award that way.  I don't know if I'll always feel this way, but I do right now, and I thought I would let you know because, well, that seemed like the best thing to do.  I don't know what I would do around here if not for your support  I likely wouldn't still be editing, or at least my vacation would be lasting a bit longer.

So far you have only based your claim on a web site.  Iranica does NOT say that Aryanem Vaejo is in Afghanistan, nor does Iranica say that any part of Afghanistan has ever been called Ariana.  If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and ``Ariana`` for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines ``Ariana Airlines``.  You seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. This is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. Your parents have produced a foolish Mr. Know It All who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  This is stupid.  I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong: :::1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.    :::2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of ``Iran Vij`` which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.  :::3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as ``Aria`` in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with ``Aryan`` and others picked it up.)  :::4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called ``Ariana``.  :::5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called ``Ariana`` or ``Aryana``.  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the ``official afghanis website says so`` you only show how weak your argument is.  :::5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] ``the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan``  well, that is not good enough.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not the official website of Afghanistan.  What ``the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan`` is irrelevant here.

So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000). :Well, sure, but that's weak``35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't``. Come on. That's not serious.  ::But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote. :Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, ``son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right.`` So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people?

I know Tila does mostly softcore work, but if you search around you will see she appears in films caressing other women in the nude and in a very explicitly sexual manner that is intended to arouse the viewer.  I think she at least qualifies as an erotic actress, even if not completely a porn star.     == Cuyamaca ==  I noticed that you added the merge tag to Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca, California. I originally created a single article but it seemed to me that towns and villages tend to have dedicated articles so I split the article in two. I'm inclined to agree that a single article would be sufficient. Is this consistent with other articles that cover a city, town or village and the like-named region in which they sit? If so, in your opinion, should the articles be consolidated under ``Cuyamaca`` or ``Cuyamaca, California``?    I couldn't find enough information about the village to expand it so I merged Cuyamaca with Cuyamaca, California and marked Cuyamaca for deletion. I assume that all the other particulars, such as the duplicate article page, will be taken care of.      thanks for the edits of my pages, I'm often vague and I forget formatting. ps how do you do that neat thing where you make you name ant the time you commented appear after posting a ``talk`` thing? -maximusnukeage  ==Re: Models Wikiproject== That sounds like a good idea.  How do we go about doing it?      ==UK railway stations - J== Hi. I've reverted your wikification of the UK railway stations - J page. By convention, the entries in the leftmost column are only wikilinked once there is a railway station article for the town/city/locale. Your links go to what are, in the context of a list of UK railway stations, random pages ( best wishes  I've created a  basic article for Jewellery Quarter station and inserted a link for just that station.    == Northern vs. Southern California speech ==  In response to your question on the Regional American English talk page, I think it would be fascinating to see a section on differences between Northern and Southern California speech, especially since both regions seem to have distinct characters. Of course, it would be helpful if you could provide other examples, but the one you cited would be a good start, too.    ==Culture of Greece==  Culture of Greece is this week's Collaboration of the week.  Please come and help it become a featured-standard article.  == Confirmation ==  Jeff, are you sure that her surname is Lee? In the English context, evidence is provided that she is Lee, Sung Hi or Sung Hi-Lee, which says that Sung is her surname. However, using Hangul or Hanja/Hanzi to search, her surname is Lee. You may be correct, but try searching using these methods that I stated. Thanks,   ==Tila Nguyen== She was in the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious.   == Re: Current Events, death of Iris Chang ==  I put the mention of her death back into the current events section that you removed.  Yes, there is a list of deaths on the right, but it does not contain links to outside news articles.  Also note that Yasser Arafat's death is listed in the main section of the page even though he is listed in the deaths section.  If you have any comments/questions please reply to my talk page.     : I removed the notice of her death, and not Arafat's, because Arafat was a major politician who played an enormous role in his part of the world, and Ms. Chang is a (noted) pop-historian.

As the Wikipedia page says: ``. . .You can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a URL surrounded by single square brackets; this does not provide as much information to readers, but it is much better than not citing your sources at all`` Interestingly, I see you have only attacked and vandalized the Quotes website, and none of the Watchtower's multiple links, no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975. You have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site; merely saying ``it's not useful`` is a deadpan POV with no basis but your own fear of reality, and your desperate urged to manipulate the public.

The onus of proof in an encyclopedia ought to be on the people making a positive claim - and if no one can find evidence of its existence it ought to go.  The same way there is no page on the existence of unicorns.  The spikes thing is clear an ex posto rationalisation as there are no existing models (and probably never were) and what evidence there is is that the spikes did not move.  People, for some reason, want to believe this is true and are very very resistent to the truth.  Wikipedia should not be in the business of peddling half-baked urban legends.  It ought to go entirely, but failing that it ought to be modified until such time someone can provide evidence of its existence.  Which I suspect no one will.

Believe me, I'd rather help you than block you.  So, here's some reading material:  Wikipedia:Manual of style.  This is an excellent resource for learning how to contribute here.  I'm also as close as my talk page.  Sorry to have come off harsh, but you wouldn't believe the sort of really weird edits from people who mean to harm the site instead of help it.  I'm extremely pleased to help you if you'd like. -    Wiki brah, why did you move a nomination for admin?  I'm not objecting, just confused.  Also, btw, how did you come across that page - it's not a usual page for new users to come across at first. Thanks in advance for your response.    ==Ho cakes==  Uh, right.  )  WB, what are you doing...?  I said I'd help you but if you do another edit like that last one, it'll be a time out.  OK?  No more weirdness?  Thanks. -    Well, in order to stay, your articles really need to meet a certain level of quality.  I'm sure you mean well, but you really need to settle down a tad and get a feel for the site.  You can't treat this like a blog page.  ``Ho cakes?``  I admit, it made me laugh, especially the ``featured article`` header.  But...stuff like that really isn't the best use of the site's resources.  The nice folks who pay for the servers want the best possible return on their investment.  Tell you what:  I have to run, but if you have an idea for an article, why not stop by my talk page and let me know what it is?  Maybe if I show you how to write a good article, you might understand WIkipedia better. -    It's OK.  We'll get you up to speed.  However, you should decide on a single user name.  Right now, you're bouncing between three of them.  How 'bout we just stick with this one here? -    :Last warning.  If you continue to post nonsense, or to disrupt Wikipedia by slapping a delete template on Cindy Sheehan, you WILL be blocked.     Actually, that is exactly what I was coming here to do.  That was uncalled for as was ``Monkey spank.``  Gotta give you a time out for a couple of days for disrupting this site.  Nothing personal.  However, you can still edit this page if you wish to respond to the block. -    == Good Morning ==  so what are you doing and going on?  Why is everyone being mean to me?  I am just trying to help.  I read some guidelines and articles and don't think she is a notable person just like a stuntwoman on tv for brief fame.  I am getting better but still sort of autistic my parents still keep me here.   No one wants to be mean to you.  I had a feeling you were autistic and I'm working with a couple of other autistic users.  We welcome you here.  But, you need to remember that this isn't a playground and that you simply can't edit the way you have been.  I'm giving you one more chance.  I'll remove your block, but only if you do the right thing, OK?  Let us all help you. -    OK, Brah.  I've unblocked you.  Now, please be good and edit like I know you can.  I have to go, but I'm keeping an eye on you.  )  Thanks. -     Hi, WB.  Man, I'm glad it was you and not the vandal I'm dealing with right now who's messing up my page.    If you want, I'll gladly paste that English-speaking template to your user page.  As far as making templates is concerned, they're pretty much like making articles, but I think you have to have the green light from other users before you create one.  I'll look into that for you.  Gotta run after I fix your user page. -    ==Take a look==  Think you'll like your user page now.

If not, my change should be reverted and we should get some consensus here in case I'm a clod. -  ", "6": [{"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3965, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3983, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2531, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2909, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2213, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3340, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1740, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 908, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3990, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3924, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 22796896, "tg": 0.3}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 22798168, "2": "  Mark Jacobs  markjacobs8@comcast.net", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3791, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3825, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 142, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 729, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1145, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1525, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2401, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2457, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3162, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 263, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 22798168, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 22842559, "2": "might just have made an innocent mistake, maybe out of a misunderstanding of copyright rules?    ::I am sorry that you yet again jump to conclusions (as previously sideing me with SecretLondon).

I also disagree with your count of votes for the related article, Sin Star. By my count there were five delete votes \u2014 the same five who voted to delete Mind Pollution \u2014 but you only counted four, one merge vote from Factitious, and three keep votes from sin-thetik, the article creator.  I would suggest that in the future when closing votes you check the history to determine the authorship of unsigned votes. I also think the quality and nature of the arguments presented are more important than the raw vote count. I would like to renominate these articles, but I'm not sure what the rules on that are.

Central, can you explain something to me? You obviously don't like JWs so why do you spend so much time thinking about us? Personally, I try to avoid thinking about things that I don't like or that make me upset. Yet I notice that JWs and related articles are the only subject you deal with on WP. I doesn't [sic] make any sense to me at all - what's up with that! As it says on the WP main page, ``In this English version, started in 2001, we are currently working on 730,275 articles.`` Wouldn't you be happier branching out to some of the other subjects on WP. Just a thought. DannyMuse ``   Ho hum, here we go. . . I see your inevitable desire to posit straw men has taken the better of you again (yawn). You stated: ``You obviously don't like JWs. . .`` Actually Danny I have some friends who are JWs, and I have no problem with them as individual per se. If you actually opened your eyes for once you would see I have problems with your religious leaders, not JWs. Although rank and file JWs are still responsible for selling their literature and promoting the false teachings of the Watch Tower commercial publishing organisation.   Your second reality admittance is very revealing, you said: ``I try to avoid thinking about things that I don't like or that make me upset.`` You sure do Danny, as do most JWs, and don't think it hasn't been noted by thousands of viewers of these pages. Very sad indeed when someone who claims he is part of the ``channel of God``, and ``the only narrow road to salvation``, shrinks back in fear whenever you see anything you don't like. This is exactly why so many in this world get deceived and trapped in false religions, they just look away when reality comes knocking. This is also why you will most probably waste the rest of your life in a region that is not what it claims to be and lose your future opportunities with God through self-deception. Danny, never underestimate the power of denial, it will steal all your relationship with God, and you will probably let that happen.  Danny, I will not argue with you, as you are not ready to see reality at present, I pray one day you will be able, but maybe that time is not yet. I will leave it with God, if he wants you, he will open your eyes. Until then, I will leave you with some advice from your own organisation; on this occasion, you should take that advice. Regards, , 15 September 2005  :``Even some religious people have closed minds. They are interested only in ``their`` religion, showing no willingness to as much as listen to the views of others. And even though they may not have chosen their religion but simply have inherited it from their parents, still they feel that their religion must be right. But not every inheritance is necessarily good. . . What makes a religion right is its total adherence to God's Word. Whether our religion meets this criterion or not can only be determined by open-mindedly comparing it with the Bible. . Why, some people have even been known to doubt the truthfulness of a message simply on the basis of where the message bearer came from . . An open mind is willing to do what 1 John 4:1 recommends. It says: ``Beloved ones, do not believe every inspired expression, but test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.``\u2014Awake! 22 November 1984  pp.8-10  :``If you find that a doctrine or teaching is a lie, you should quickly forsake it, regardless of who teaches it or how long you have believed that teaching to be true. Your own welfare and your duty to God demand that you abandon lies, no matter who teaches them. . . God hates a speaker of lies. (Proverbs 6:16-19) ``A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish. . .

Unless, of course, you wish to say that eliminating the social class of peasants is in some way trivial, and hence it would trivialize the killing of the Jews as an ethnic group by association.   Calling the holodomor and the related events a holocaust rather puts those events in the right perspective: there WAS both CALLOUS and deliberate killing of the undesired class during the holodomor that was NOT principally ANY different from the shoa.

Since I am myself a social-democrat, I can't say that there is any kind of bias against left-wing POV's here.

We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)  It is precisly the regions of the ``Sindhu River`` between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of ``Kashmir`` and ``Punjab`` the real home of Hinduism and ``indoaryans`` (indoiranians).  So what i mean, is that if we talk about ``gypsy`` people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.  That is why many people feel (i am one) that ``roma`` people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say).   Precisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).  That is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. M  Many gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.  We must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains.   The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.   I believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the ``Indoaryan`` of  orgin worriors of ``iranian origin`` that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.   Gypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani (Persian)Afghani(Pashtu)-Punjabi-Kashmiri-Rajasthani-Harayana-Brhamman cultures of indoeuropean or irani-scythian-greekish influence and language...   Gypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS, the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania, Hungary and Russia; and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in Country,Rock and Roll-Hippie Music, Fox Trot-Jazz; and ofcourse latin american rythms like: Rumba, Salsa, Bolero, Tango, Peruvian Valse, Tondero, Zamacueca, Charchalera, Milonga etc...  It errant living and the suffering of a worrior people that pridley did not accept the imposition of mongolian or muslim invaders; so they fled with their women and similar tribes of indoaryan origin into the western regions; saddly to know they to large and were not given any help they dedicated themselves to music, entertainment (circus-acrobats-scene players) and poets; yet they mained t", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1204, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1345, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1221, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1212, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 598, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 660, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 133, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 507, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 219, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 266, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 23526460, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 23532301, "2": "` Ang again, I have no problem with the NPOV policy it is merely that the minority view should not be stifled in a minority view article.

Does some person keep changing the theological conservative Christianity  internal link in the Biblical scientific foreknowledge (BSF) article so it goes to the Christian right (Falwell, etc).

But I have covered most of this already. I am asking you kindly to please review the facts and consider changing your vote to keep the article.   *Look the point summarized is I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating ``There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)`` If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do ? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)  I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them.

Does the band/artist have any full length CDs available and what label? Are they for sale anywhere on-line? Did they perform in any tour? If so, is there any verifiable evidence of this?``  They have had 2 national which tours can be verified by looking through the entries on the Internet Archives - Archive.org when viewing past sites for http://mind-pollution.net, http://sinstar.net, and http://marilyn-manson.net  as well as some other sites. All of these were listed and cited as sources. I also provided some links in my rebuttle to further proove this. As far as their CDs Mushroomcloud Records has the enry for ``we whill be heard 2`` which is a compilation released by a notable indie label. The other releases have not been full length or distributed for Sin Star however Mind Pollution did have a few albums avalible in store catalouges (CDs stores don't stock but sell) but because of legal trouble mentioned in the articles everything was forced to be discontinued immediately. But after all 1 requirement needs to be met for WP:MUSIC. This band has gathered a very large following and your right sooner or later there will be an acceptable article on them. But I do not see why this is not the case now seeing as how they meet the requirements and are linked to some very interesting famous people like Gidget Gein and Marilyn Manson directly.

Once any currently-being-voted-on VfD's are converted to AfD (I think that happened already quite some time ago), the old archived ones can be converted at much more leisurely pace, no?

My worry is specifically that vandals may sneak in some pagemove vandalism in there that no one will catch, in the midst of thousands and thousands of other pagemoves, or a vanity userspace page will get moved to article space and no one will catch it (last time I checked, such a pagemove didn't show up in the Newpages log).

WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN? You are obviously not aware of what is goinf \u00b4g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes. I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it. But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish. An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang. Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the \u00b4factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair. It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this. Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her proteg\u00e9 had been blocked. i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight. You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit. She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it. She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi. She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much. She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff. The arbitration should have been about this too. They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds. And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it. He even insulted Nicholas turnbull. Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves. Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikip\u00e9dia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.  This has to stop. I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate. He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request. This don't go and has to be aborted. I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.  None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration. It is a close debate and not an arena game. THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning. He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted. He must be removed as well. i dont accept what happened tonight.

It was done by me already in august this year, and you will know it if you could read. You don't know about fact as yu don't know about the scientific methods. You are rants. You speak on an arbitration where you are most unwelcome with the same empty sind as you pass your idiotic sonnet and your fat ass: happy of your ignorancy and passing the marshmallow.     For what it is worth, I support this motion. XAL has contributed nothing to the discussion, in stark contraindistinction to most of the other users like Igor or rbj or ybm, and often stirs things up. Maru (talk)    No comments, see the art gallery for concret proove that what he say reflect what he is and does, not my doing and being. This is again a projection.      All the people who are now playing in the kindergarten called the arbitration, are all without exception people who weren't there when the reason for this arbitration was decided: in august and first week of september. So pack your dirty loundry and found a more constructiv way to wash your personal problems and clear out your relationships issues. This arbitration is about the reality of an organisation having build up this whole affair since nov 2003 up to today, and known as the postsituationists group, under the direction of Jean Pierre Voyer, directing the actions to be taken in close cooperation with YBM. The rest is rant and superficiality. it has been cleared out for a month and a week ago that the subject of the talk page was not wether the theory were validate or not but on the validity of this affair. Since I came with proove of the actions of the organisation, the talk page has became a complete rant and battle field with most participation from rjb who know absolutely nothing from it but who notheless play the all knowing man from day one.

I was always told you were the persuasive one because of your cool calm reasoned responses and up until now I had no reason to doubt this and have always accorded you the respect of analyzing your arguments and either agreeing or disagreeing.  But you both shock and surprise me with a personal attack in your very fist sentence. To suggest that I'm some knee-jerk reactionary spoling for a fight with the left wing cabal is to caricature me in a grossly distorted way. I  'm here to remove POV. Period. Now, it is acknowledged by you and others that there are currently a preponderance of liberals in here doing the editing, although no one until you would be willing to admit that there was a left-wing cabal and a sinister one at that!   (Remember, you can't say you were 'just joking' because, as we've learned from the liberal editors of the Ann Coulter piece, unless you SPECIFICALLY say 'I was joking' when you make your statment, it means you're as serious as AIDS- so I thank you for that illuminating revelation. It is duly noted.)  Anyway, it stands to reason that most of the POV I will encounter is going to be coming from the left. Do you dispute that or do you think this Karl Rove article is filled with right wing hyperbole?  As for your arguement - ``we have to interrupt his biography to go off on a side excursion, an article-within-an-article that discusses the subject he addressed...`` I can only say McCain...Black Baby Rumor...see above. lol!   I find it hard to believe you can make that arguement with a straight stroke. It is PRECISELY that tit for tat meandering that is the HALLMARK of Ann Coulter and Karl Rove articles. I wish you'd use your persuasive powers to address the McCain push poll incident and Ann Coulters alleged love for terrorists instead of cherry-picking it in a realm where Rove might actually be vindicated.  So, I reject your argumentation for now. In fact, I've understood that Move-On's petition may have been specifically what Rove was referring to. Therefore to omit this information would be a deliberate attempt to leave that quote hanging out there and thus tantamount to POV by default.  And I think one 911 family group comments deserves another. Or, if you like, we can just use the conservative 911 family group's statements. Since we  don't want to make this article 'book-length' do we?   Here's my bottom line: What's good for the goose is good for the gander. And what I've seen here since day one is one form of argumentation used to defend an article if it's good for the goose (democrat/liberal) and that EXACT SAME ARGUMENTATION trashed if it looks good for the gander (republican/conservative.) I hope you don't think I'm the only one who sees this. (Oh btw, when I make post these trenchant observations, I'm used to getting rebuked for 'getting away from content' or 'talking politics.' Funny, how your comments of the exact same nature never get that same rebuke.  Must be 'cabal club' privileges, huh? ) Take care Big Daddy. Ps I do like your style though.

Will you then tell me ``there is no place for poetry in an article about religion?`` This is what Bektashi culture is about, and this kind of censorship is unacceptable.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2016, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 160, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1553, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2061, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2069, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 533, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2000, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1754, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1875, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1987, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 24979868, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 24984566, "2": "  ==KaiserHatners edits==  Hi KaiserHatner, I think your recent edits are fine.

I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.  2) This is new. It's from Conason: ``Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments.`` Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.  3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: `` She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as ``harmless American citizens`` [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.`` Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent.   This quote is also troubling: ``Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing.`` Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this: ``Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.``  Whady'a say?  (Much more on this section later.)  4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.  5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are ``not as bright`` as men'? Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

The Security General had ruled Syrian occupied Lebanon for almost two decades. His knowledge of the intelligence and terrorism web is boundless. Some sources in Syria and Lebanon, reacting to the news this morning called the death, an ``assisted suicide.`` Kanaan, according to these sources knew ``significantly`` about the assassins of former Prime Minister Hariri. He ``committed`` suicide as the time President Assad would be addressing world opinion and the American public via CNN.`` Walid Phares  Phares on al Hurra TV: ``Syria: General Kanaan's ``assisted`` suicide?`` Phares on al Hurra TV: ``General Ghazi Kanaan was the security ruler of Syrian-occupied Lebanon for decades. He has ordered executions, torture, transfer to Syrian prisons and has been in the center of Syrian connections with Terrorist regimes and organization for 30 years. He knew mountains of information on Terror and crimes executed in Lebanon and the region. He was on the UN commission's list of high suspects in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.

Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of ``Russian torsion field weapons`` and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on ``The Philadelphia Experiment`` and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the ``saucers`` really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper ``On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics``. pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in ``this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics`` to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin.

I'm glad the whole poll thing is over, but what is the overall conclusion:   1. the naming committee will discuss on the matter of Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs name 2. Macedonian Slavs stays until another poll is organized or 3. a status quo for an indefinite period of time?  Since you seem to be the only neutral admin actively engaged in this debate, it seem to me that you are the right person to ask these questions....    :If a poll doesn't reach a decision, the poll is treated as moot and the status quo is continued. I agree that the name ``Macedonian Slavs`` is inappropriate (and many of the arguments made against using it were blatantly POV). The problem is that right now we don't have a mechanism for ensuring that the name is decided objectively. I'll have a chat with the other admins to see if anything can be done in the short term (bear in mind that the naming committee is just a proposal, it's not been endorsed yet).    ::: I would like you to know that I appreciate your active involvement in the Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs issue, because if it is left to polls to decide such delicate matters, Wikipedia would soon degenerate. The English Wikipedia, and its mirror sites are the most important generators of the Macedonian Slavs term on the net - , which is much unfortunate, because it makes the term more ``common`` than it actually is. There was a brief period of some ``Macedonian Slavs`` references in BBC or CNN's news articles (the first half of 2001), but they have withdrawn the term very soon. The naming committee is a good idea to resolve matters of this type, since the naming of the article itself is a specific NPOV question - the different POV's can hardly be ``described`` in it. I don't want to leave the impression that I'm trying to put a pressure on you, but please resolve this dispute in a reasonable period of time (that is, don't forget about it -)). Thanks again for your contributions.    ::Just remember that we need to figure out what is neutral, not what is objectively correct. A committee which ``votes`` on what is ``objectively correct`` will not get ``endorsed``. This is the kind of thing which probably cannot be decided by a committee. See Wikipedia:naming conflict.     :::I didn't say we should decide what is correct, merely what the common usage is. What I'm arguing against is the use of arguments such as ``they don't have a right to use this name``, which is what's been happening so far. BTW, the link you provided doesn't work - could you point me to the right place?     ::Sorry about the red link thing. I was using it as a ``forward reference``. That is, I made a comment referring to a policy page BEFORE writing that policy page.

We can, of course, say that P rejects X's use of the name Y.     === The Naming Committee ===  Hi, it's me again. About two weeks have passed since the end of the Macedonians/Macedonians Slavs poll.

This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:  In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today\u2019s useful idiots.   [Ali Sina] states: \u201cThey are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.\u201d  The same author writes: \u201cMore abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.`` Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.\u201d   Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her.   In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn\u2019t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution \u201chate speech\u201d. What about the Quran? Isn\u2019t that book a hate speech?    Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules.   If you try to write anything that Muslims don\u2019t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn\u2019t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published?   I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed?   Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1579, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2559, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2674, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3211, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2951, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2509, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 492, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3903, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3844, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3900, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 26335756, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 26369636, "2": "`  There's always one guy who'll say, ``Meh, close enough.``  I suppose I'm him, here, but, at the same time, you're absolutely correct.

Given that we are always already out of compliance with some browser or OS (e.g. does anyone know how far ``Windows MediaCenter`` or ``Longhorn`` are going to shove the old fonts out of whack), the kludge-y but best solution might well be to use an unusable typographical symbol (*, ^, #) and have a ``Key`` that indicates that that symbol was used for the yogh.

I was a physics major in a major university for a couple years, eventually broadened out to other things, but I can still read Pauli and Reichenbach without feeling that I got caught in the spin cycle of a rug washer. The same isn't true of the Wikipedia physics articles.  I've tried to clear up the philosophy of QM article that is under rfd, but Mr. Ingham has not answered my questions about what he is trying to say in a responsive way. The ``simplified`` article looks like a better place to start.  My experience in physics at the University level may be relevant. We had a trimester system. The first trimester was mechanics. I did o.k., but calculus was new to me. The second semester was electricity. Since I had shocked myself working on old radios, made crystal radios, etc., etc. for years, I already knew what was going on. In some ways I was ahead of our grad student lab leader, who couldn't understand why putting one probe of a volt meter into the DC outlet on the lab bench did not produce a reading. My grade jumped to A, not because I was any smarter, but because I knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel, and to other students such matters were totally abstract. I think that students should begin with real-world experiences as much as possible. Unfortunately, many students live in very restricted environments. If you live in a high-rise apartment building you might not realize you could just trail the antenna for a crystal radio out the window.

Municipalities and cities are composed of barangays.  Each barangay is headed by a barangay captain (punong barangay) i.e. the district mayor, who leads the barangay council (sangguniang barangay) composed of barangay councilors (kagawad). Every barangay also has a Youth Council (``Sangguniang Kabataan`` or ``SK``) composed of the SK President or Chairman and SK Councilors, who direct the youth-oriented activities, such as basketball leagues and other youth oriented activities, in the barangay.  Historically, a barangay is a relatively small community of around 50 to 100 families. Most villages have only thirty to one hundred houses and the population varies from one hundred to five hundred persons. According to Legazpi, he found communities with twenty to thirty people only. Many coastal villages in the Visayan region consisted of no more than eight to ten houses. The word itself is derived from an ancient Malay boat called a balangay. This connection between community and boat supports certain theories on the history of the pre-colonial Philippines, specifically, that each original coastal \u201cbarangay\u201d formed as a result of settlers arriving by boat from other places in Southeast Asia.

The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.  This also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the ``Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck``. I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.  However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be ``suburban``, part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.  This article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.  The inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.  I have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages. If there is no further discussion or objection, I will edit the Northern Neck page to include mention of the local debate on the status of King George County.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3957, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2531, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 546, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2549, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3801, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3633, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4019, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2119, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1515, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 593, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 27116757, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 27117648, "2": "` November 2005 (UTC) :::::::::To mention that the neighborhood where the riots are taking place, have a history of previous religious and political violence is more relevant and appropiate in this article, than it is to copy ``the entire French rule in Algeria`` article into it.

While it certainly seems strange that jokes are included on a page concerning 'religion', dismissing it completely without some discussion and consideration would be doing a disservice.  It may very well be that Bektashi culture is intimately tied to a rich collection of jokes which serve some pedagogical role in the religion.  For example, if we look at this site: : http://www.alevibektasi.org/xalevis1.htm : It is written that  ``X. Alevi-Bektashi Humor Alevis and Bektashis love to use humor to mock religious legalism, hypocrisy, and those who they feel have persecuted them. This humor reveals much about Alevi-Bektashi thought. To understand their humor is to understand the Alevi-Bektashis\u2019 approach to life, religion, and their place in society. Here are only a few examples of the hundreds of Bektashi jokes (f\u0131kralar) that have been collected. This first joke reflects the Alevi attitude toward the legalism of the five pillars``  : The author is John Shindeldecker, and he is listed as one of the researchers on the fairly official-looking homepage  : http://www.alevibektasi.org/makale_engl.htm : In this case, this material suggests that humor is an integral part of defining Bektashi culture as distinctive from other factions of Islam.  Much as Zen Buddhism is characterized by the sometimes meaningless Koans or Gospel music in certain factions of Protestant Christianity.  In all of these cases, I don't think it's fair to say that it's like ``adding black jokes to an article about African Americans.``  This comparison is also a bit overreaching, and unwarranted.  AldirmaGonul has made a good faith case for why the jokes should be placed on this page.  freestylefrappe has deleted it by only saying that it's ``suspect`` and ``racist``.  But given what we read from another source, this seems an overly simplified and inaccurate depiction of the ``jokes`` section.  I would like to hear an argument against these lines of evidence from freestylefrappe. `", "6": [{"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1636, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1621, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1629, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1663, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1689, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1642, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1498, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 489, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 562, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1449, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 27132410, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 27195978, "2": "  You mentined an international site on Croatian history?

Grace is exactly what he has given Marcellus and, to a large degree, what Marcellus has given him after his rescue. This is in the original script and, I believe, another piece reinforcing the redemption theme so prevalent in this film.     Also it is interesting to note that Marcellus seems more interested in mercy and grace after, perhaps, and if,  he has received back his soul, which some allege was in the infamous briefcase. Ultimately, in the film, responding to grace becomes important when Jules redeems Ringo in the dinner and walks away from ``The Life``. Vincent does not and ends up dead. Jules sees the miracle and grace and responds ``trying real hard, Ringo, to be the shepard``.

Please don't feel any need to insult me over this  I don't have any real belief that your interested in anything I have to say.  But anyway, in this imaginary world where you actually are interested in my advice, I would tell you that, in the capacity of an arbitrator, you've written a summary of the focus of the dispute that (a) includes an alleged statement of the opinion of one party to the dispute that that party has denied, and that (b) the other side of the dispute seems to think is inaccurate. Again in this imaginary world, I would suggest to you that maybe it would be more productive to re-write the damn summary that no one likes rather than, say, to write a new article about Wikilawyering.

I don't think he will, but I noted to you that I wouldn't start looking for someone to write the second notice to you for a day or two, so I'll spend that time ``mentoring`` El C before I seriously start looking.  In fairness, I think I should tell you that, while I do think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter, and I really will pursue it to the very end, I find your attitude pretty amusing, and it is entertaining for me (in some dark way, perhaps) to see the innovative and gymnastic things you come up with in order to avoid doing what seems to me to be quite obviously the right thing to do. I'm telling you this because possibly you find the whole thing very annoying and draining  as indeed I would, if I were continually having to make up new reasons for not doing what is obviously the right thing to do  and if that's the case, this could be a bad situation for you: you're drained while I'm entertained. Now, probably some worthy will turn my words here against me, and claim (ignoring my clear statement that I think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter) that I am just trying to be annoying to you.

Rickk had almost as many as the next 3 people combined.   ::Personally? I frequently saw his edits, and he left a useful note on my talk page correcting me for something.    :::Isn't it obvious to everyone?  RickK created a whole entourage of sockpuppets, then vandalised with them, then blocked them.  Just to fulfill his self-aggrandising dreams.  He made fools of us all, just to prove that he was brilliant.  Don't you hate him?  Kill RickK, kill RickK, kill RickK'''!    ::::I can safely say that ever since RickK's departure, I have been faced with reverting five times the vandalism I did prior, which still dosen't come close to his legendary vandal fighting, troll combatting, and trash disposing.   :::::Nonsense! I wish him and his many sockpuppets stay out!    :::To Raul654, now that I can believe ). Statistics on the effect of handing out bans liberally would be great to have.     My experience in the Wikiworld has shown RickK to be abusive of other users, authoritarian, consistently reverting other peoples edits without apparent reason and unwilling to join a debate on a given subject when his arguments were confronted. Personally, Im glad he gave up.   ::::::``Rick, it's interesting to note that since you left", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2619, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2663, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2765, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 996, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2016, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2829, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2825, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2824, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2812, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 535, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 28872703, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 28888674, "2": "I mean, aren't we supposed to take a neutral perspective in the first place???

It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?  Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.``  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.``  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.``    The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.``  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.``  The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.     Wikipedia's liars use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.  Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html  Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.  The Wikipedia article for the ``Roman salute`` used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: ``The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute.

They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.``  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.``  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.``  The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.``  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.``  The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.    Wikipedia's cons use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.  Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html  Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.

Maimonides' version clearly is widely used  Wikipedia's own article on the 613 mitzvot includes Maimonides' list as its only example, and describes Maimonides' work that included the list as ``The most important of the above works`` from a list of works that include versions of the list. It is also the only version that I have seen reproduced anywhere online. While Jay claims that the absence of aliyah from Maimonides' list should not be mentioned because virtually every other list includes it, that is not logical if Maimonides' list is ``the most important`` of the lists; it is essentially original research for Jay to conclude that the singularity of the absence of aliyah to Maimonides' list makes it not worth mentioning. :I'm sure it is true that others of Maimonides' writings indicate what Jay alleges, but the text from the article refers particularly to the 613 commandments. It would make sense (in fact, when I replace the wording, I'll do it myself) to note that Maimonides' other writings tend to contradict the omission, but that does not necessarily nor, I think, in fact warrant suppressing the note about the ``most important`` of the mitzvot lists being the exception to the statement in the article. :Jay describes the clarification as ``uncited POV,`` which may be true regarding ``most widely,`` which I eliminated, but not ``widely,`` nor anything else about the clarification.

Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia\u2019s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.    Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. A image search on the web for the \u201coriginal pledge of allegiance\u201d provides additional information.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text ``military salute became the Nazi salute.``  Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. ``  Additional information is available in image or text searches for \u201cswastika secrets.\u201d   Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``    Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the ``Roman salute`` article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.  The Wikipedia article for the ``Roman salute`` used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: ``The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.`` Wikipedia liars also used the painting ``The Oath of the Horatii`` as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates \u201c1787?-1934?\u201d with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.  Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.  Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer ``public schools`` when they mean ``government schools`` and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called ``military socialism``) within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.  Some regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 10, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1652, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 599, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -2.0, "wi": 2177, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2367, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2399, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3588, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3791, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 686, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 377, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 30127572, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 30171162, "2": "`:I don't have a defective edition.

Thanks.     :: QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as ``1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.`` First of all, ``all editors have reached a consensus on the article`` is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others ``have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system``, Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with ``- For a start,`` Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in ``the clearest possible words`` when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss ``differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)``, and then again , who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as ``One that tells lies`` and ``a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly``, if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying!

The very language is despiteful. My every contribution to Islamofascims, Islamofobia and Ali Sina are removed. The only reason is because they are not in agreement with Islamic creed. We must not allow Wikipedia to be converted into an Islamic tool of propaganda. Both views must be expressed equally. Take the example of Sina\u2019s page. There we have six comments made by anonymous Muslims calling him all names including a mischievous liar, a rabid anti Islamist, Islamophobe, etc. In the paragraph that said \u201cAli Sina is a controversial personality\u201d I quoted an example of how diverse are the opinions of Sina\u2019s fans from those of his foes.  This is not to agree with those opinions. Muslims resisted this example tooth and nail, with all inane and invalid excuses. I made it clear that this is not an endorsement of those views and the notability of the people making those allegations or praises are not important. They are just a sample of what people say about him. It goes from one extreme to another. I think both examples should be stated so the claim that he is a controversial is supported with these examples.

Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans. After 1880, however, the steady decrease of aliens, and,the development of the Black Sea ports, rendered the Dobrudja a source of prosperity to Rumania.", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4027, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3322, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3098, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4191, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2584, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2327, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1292, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1213, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4029, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3021, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 31245281, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 31256555, "2": "  :::Thank you Baba I joined SIIEG and added it to my watchlist.

The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is ``covered up`` by people and also people often refer to it as the ``Nazi-Soviet`` pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as ``Nazis`` (they did not refer to themselves as ``Nazis``).  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as ``It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!``  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word ``Nazi`` to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase ``National Socialist.`` The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment ``Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!``   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name ``Union of Soviet Socialist Republics`` and also used the term ``Communist`` instead of using the term ``Socialist.``  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide including in Germany.       Yes, the ``Roman salute`` page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term ``conspiracy.`` It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.        The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who ``became wiser``, by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as ``S`` shapes standing for its ``Socialism`` is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swa", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2400, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2404, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2406, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2111, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1892, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1392, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1815, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1851, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2422, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2415, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 31561176, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 31574852, "2": "  == Michael Ealy ==  Please stop.

An earlier version referenced the work of Professor Rex Curry and started thusly: ``The Roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palms down. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. The salute was supposed to have been used in the Roman republic, but there is no clear evidence of this. Indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in Roman culture`` (by Paul Barlow).  A more recent version of the same article is written as if a neo-Nazi has been covering-up again.  A big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase ``Roman salute`` and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.  The article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of Dr. Curry, conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the Roman Republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in Roman culture.  The wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the ``Roman Salute`` concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted Roman images in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.    The wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the ``Roman Salute`` concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.    For example, there is no evidence that Jacques-Louis David actually thought that his painting ``The Oath of the Horatii`` represented an actual historical Roman salute.  All of the evidence indicates that David created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. All of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. The intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by Dr. Curry http://rexcurry.net/pledgehoratii.html  Further, the Horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.  The Tennis Court Oath was painted by David later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in a more modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. David was not there. Further, the oath was was written on paper (the paper being read by the central figure?) and the ``oath was taken`` by signing the document. There is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting (the central figure might be swearing, or he might be reading his document) while those people about him waive hats, talk, holler, point, etc.  Three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the Horatii painting.  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.  The distribution of the Eagle Standards was painted by David even later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in another modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all.  The wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings.  That painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oath-taking or at all and simply shows various people, with various gestures, acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for, and shouting for, the ``Eagle Standards.``  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.  The wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straight-arm g", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 216, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 276, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 315, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 468, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 987, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1037, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 132, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1133, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1089, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1142, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 31624227, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 31626095, "2": "  == Colours on maps ==  Hi, Gdr.

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you ``founded`` and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.  You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone ``producing`` dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are ``in it for the money``, yet:  You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are ``producing`` ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!  You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another ``compatible`` (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the ``substitute`` puppy you decide to offer them. (see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....``New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements``).  It appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you ``produce`` who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.    You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you ``produce`` them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life.   You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you ``produce``, should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.  Your ``Policies and Prices`` make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new ``pets``, in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.

Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well)   You have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced ``welder``, save for I'm sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven't been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?    HOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I've read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can't stand things which don't come up in google counts.  The list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of ``authoritative`` sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a ``school of thought`` on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything ``so they say``.    X-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.  A highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.  This largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki's undoing.     *From my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating ``duty-cycle``) to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a 'shortness' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.  Aluminum for example is notorious for its ability to ``wick`` (conduct) heat away from the p", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3234, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3616, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3642, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3900, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1472, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1265, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 539, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1871, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2277, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2997, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 31865445, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 31868995, "2": "Without this thought in mind, the machine may automatically trip OFF, or burn itself up right in the middle of a very important weld.  *", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2675, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 670, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1692, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1395, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1875, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3326, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3305, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3300, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1890, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3143, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 31868995, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 31921852, "2": "`  I feel bad, too, JG. I know I can have a real smart, sarcastic mouth when I get totally frustrated, and when it gets going, look out! I apologize... Seriously. I don't want bad blood between us.  I do have a POV, of course. We all do. But in an entry that is explaining the traditionalist POV (where there is ``the`` trad POV), it matches. And when it comes to external links/further reading (not ``sources``), then traditionalist websites deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to ``An Orthodox Hannukah`` or ``Reformed Readings for Hannukah,`` but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can't add a link for balance, or add ``a traditional Catholic site`` tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removes and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summaries.  I am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled ``a traditional Catholic site`` or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex., is labelled a ``conservative`` or ``neo-conservative`` site  not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains).   I'm glad you liked at least most of the page on the Rosary! (I think if you looked at the links mentioned in my RfC, you will actually like them, too  at least most of them. Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the ``Customs of the Liturgical Year`` section. There is nothing like it out there on the Net, and I'm not finished yet!) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives/neo-conservatives: you use the phrase ``attacks on Pope John Paul II`` with regard to the footnote about trads' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don't see it as an ``attack`` but a criticism. Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, ``to the face`` when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).  But no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don't have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics!), there is a trad ``movement`` out there, and we have as much ``right`` to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we're not even Catholic at all and there's a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to ``Anglican Rosary practices.`` I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censored, and it frustrates me (it doubly frustrates me when links like this aren't only removed, but are labelled ``blog`` or ``[[monograph|monographs]``. It's beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it).  I will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word ``a traditional Catholic site`` or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trad site is clear. If I come across any older links that have already been added (and not all have been added by me, BTW), I will edit to do the same. Sound good?

Since the letter ``j`` doesn't exist in Greek T\u00eej-T\u00fbj became Tig later Tigr.In Greek at the end of words -is sonex is used (T\u00eej-Tijr-Tig-Tigr-Tigris).   First of all, the Persian for ``tiger`` is babr, not tigr or anything like it.  The Greek word ``tigris`` meaning ``tiger`` may be related to Persian words within the same family as ``*tigr``, but that is not the Persian meaning of the words.  Second, the Kurdish (and Farsi) word for ``arrow``, tir, comes from Middle Persian tigr  which also means ``arrow``.  Third, the word tij (or rather tiz) ``sharp`` is certainly related to tigr, but they belong to the same word family  they are not the same word.

Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.

Is this a bad thing? I don't think so - there are a lot of misconceptions about JavaScript (many of those are caused by bad tutorials on the web) and we can eliminate those by presenting a clear picture of the language. I've seen the statement that ``JavaScript doesn't support private members`` too often to be funny - even on this page before I edited that out. Stating in the article that JavaScript supports private members eliminates this misconception, but you need a code sample to prove your point. Since people can actually see with their own eyes how it works this adds to the credibility of the article. So you want to discuss closures? If you don't mention them, the article fails to mention one of the defining properties of JavaScript. If you do mention them, the shortest and cleanest way to explain the concept is through a code sample.

If you are posting also allophones and not only phonemes (the reasonable question is why you are doing this but we'll deal with this some other time), then the vowel chart should include all ten of them and not only eight with information which is an allophone and which is a phoneme. But you don't know that, do you?  Then we get to another reasonable question: why do you think that you can erase the whole vowel section with the vowel descriptions? Ha?   So: you post a chart which is WRONG and then you erase a section which is RIGHT. What the hell are you doing?

What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is ``Sulaiman al-Shaikh - ``The caricature artist Naji al-Ali`` - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection.`` While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.  On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying ``I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.``  However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.  Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.  By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

Taking the commas first, strictly speaking you are possibly correct in that they could \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used in the places that you indicate.  However, stylistically it is very bad to split sentences up into very small bits unless absolutely necessary, and it is much better to have a flowing sentence than to implement punctuation that makes the prose harder to read.

You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite. :Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed. :As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no ``freebie`` section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.) :Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 894, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1635, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 582, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1983, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2120, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2346, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2523, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2563, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 3094, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2855, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 33768071, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 33773411, "2": " ::I agree with Gflores that the new AWB should keep the verification to avoid abuse by vandals.

Before the beginning of time?    `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2539, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1710, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2604, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2494, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1661, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1517, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2498, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2603, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2596, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2579, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 34136636, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 34139706, "2": "`It isn't the Future Farmers of America anymore... as such, the main article for the FFA should NOT be titled Future Farmers of America... rather, the ``National FFA Organization```", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 103, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 104, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 105, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 23, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 10, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 101, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 85, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 82, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 81, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 35, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 102, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.36363636363636365, "wi": -1, "ri": 34139706, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "random"}, {"1": 34155499, "2": "`   == John Lott page ==  Is ``only a single`` really POV?

You are correct that this is less than clear.  Your suggested phrasing is fine.  Durand-Kerner is Newton's method simultaneously on a vector of root guesses, with the derivative of the polynomial approximated by the derivative of what the polynomial would be if its roots were the current set of guesses.  This permits a lot of redundant computation to be eliminated,  and the algorithm parallelized.  If f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a Durand-Kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.  You are correct this looks a lot like the example given in the Jacoby's method article.

Besides, during my years there, LSF regularly used the parade square in SOC for their drills and other training purposes (and I guess they still do today). All these could be witnessed by residents in nearby HDB blocks with their naked eyes. Thus, LSF activities and going-ons then were no secret.

Good to see your participation in WikiProject Indian cinema, lots needs to be done for Telugu cinema. I've been a destructive influence, mostly tagging articles on Savitri and Bhanumati as copyvios. But for Missamma and Maayabazaar, not many classic telugu movies seem to be represented. If you are interested, you may want to have a go at them, but some suggestions: Try to develop an article at one go so that we can get it featured on DYK; If it is people, add Category:Telugu people; if it is films, add Category:Telugu films; and of course, as you would know, copyvios are no-no but some sources like telugucinema.com can be good source material for facts and trivia.

I believe it gives a succinct account of the mandolin's origin. The facts- names, places and years- are footnoted. Afterwards, It became apparent that the beginning of the article had to be re-written since there was really no definition of a mandolin. So I did this (footnoted also). Now as for the question left in the sandbox regarding mandolinos and mandoras, I will leave it to another to rewrite the definitions and histories of those instruments.

If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the image qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.  If you have uploaded other images, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the ```` link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ``Image`` from the dropdown box.

From 1902-1911, he worked with Freud, and was indeed at that time known as a ``psychoanalyst``.

Although to a general lay public, Freud, Jung and Adler are often seen as the ``Big Three`` of psychoanalysis, in the strict sense, only Freud was a psychoanalyst.  Jung was an analytical psychologist and Adler an individual psychologist.

For women, it emphasizes modesty. Allah says in the Qur'an, ``And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not to display their adornment (interpreted as the hair and body-shape) except that which ordinarily appears thereof (interpreted as the face and hands) and to draw their headcovers over their chests and not to display their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, . . . .`` (surat an-Nur verse 31). All those in whose presence a woman is not obliged to practice the dress code are known to be her mahrams. Men have a dress code which is more relaxed: the loins must be covered from knee to waist. The rationale given for these rules is that men and women are not to be viewed as sexual objects.  Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, has laws against these dress codes in schools and work places. After the declaration of the Republic in 1923, as part of revolutions brought by Ataturk, a modern dress code was encouraged. It is against the law to wear a head scarf while attending public school in Turkey, as well as France, where the recently enacted rule caused huge public controversy.``  Is anyone implying that Turkey obliges women to show their naked chests and display their 'adornments'? Turkey only banned the BURQA, and it can be argued that the Quran never specifically perscribed that particular dress anyway.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2005, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4028, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4029, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3755, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3757, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 590, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3098, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3022, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3121, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3758, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 37007533, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 37017218, "2": "Why'd you block me, Curps?

Tu\u00f0man's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and he became the president of the country. A year later he proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He was reelected twice and remained in power until his death in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled ``Tudjman``.  ==The Communist==  Franjo Tu\u00f0man was born in Veliko Trgovi\u0161\u00e6e, a village in the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.  During WWII Tu\u00f0man fought on the side of Tito's partisans, where he also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the 1960s \u2014 a fact which some observers linked to the fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few Communist partisans.  Others have observed that Tu\u00f0man was probably the most educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history, strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare) \u2014 this claim is supported by the fact that generations of future Yugoslav generals based their general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (``War against war``), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan warfare.  Tu\u00f0man left active army service in 1961 to found the Institut za historiju radni\u00e8koga pokreta Hrvatske (``Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers' Movement``), and remained its director until 1967.  ==The Dissident==  Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tu\u00f0man wrote a series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav Communist establishment, and was subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi (``Great ideas and small peoples``), a monograph on political history that collided with central dogmas of Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the interconnectedness of the national and social elements in the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during WWII).  In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for alleged subversive activities during the so-called ``Croatian Spring``.  The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party chief Bakari\u00e6 in the climate of growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction with the position of the Croatian people in Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by Tito, who used the military and the police to crush what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakari\u00e6 quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and sided with the Yugoslav ruler.  During the turbulent 1971, Tu\u00f0man's role was that of the dissident who questioned the central myth of modern Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of ideology of unitary ``Yugoslavism``. Tu\u00f0man felt that this originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the 19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for domination over non-Serb peoples \u2014 from economy and a", "6": [{"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1927, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1669, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 255, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2017, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2025, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2013, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1990, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1986, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1959, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1972, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.8, "wi": -1, "ri": 37918813, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 37937368, "2": "  == Hera abandoning the Trojans ==  The section in the text about Hera's hate for Ganymede seems to be incorrect.

And the New School is pretty unorthodox with a mixture of Marxian and Post-Keynsian economists. While it does think folks like Jevons and Walras insightful I don't think it considers folks like Ricardo or Marx ignorant at all. And if you read down to Paretian Revival some of the issues in the quote are addressed. However. We can put something like the quote in the criticism section: that utility is unobservable. that utility is not measurable (this is actually realistic in my opinion - the difference between cardinal and ordinal utility). that utility is generally untestable (though predictions derived from marginal theory certainly are). And I really don't understand all this stuff about air and water. The marginal utility of a bit of air is essentially zero. Hence its price is essentially zero. And I happen to both desire and pay for water.

I'm not sure I want to learn the ropes of Wikipedia politics and egos, as the obvious value of Wikipedia is compelling enough, and the ugliness of personalities warped by power within a volunteer effort is unhealthy to that effort. The impulse to characterize someone who stands up for their contribution as ``nasty`` or ``threatening`` ... the see-what-I-mean response to a contributor not aware of the emotional satisfaction some may draw from arbitrary deletions, from deliberately provoked confrontations to assure themselves of their own power, is sad. All my foregoing comments no doubt cements some of you more firmly in your smugness and self-satisfaction. Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures  but does not ultimately tolerate.  i am asked to let it drop. I don't claim to be a Wiki expert, but I bet there is a complaint procedure. Anyone care to point me in the right direction? The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem. That's probably the most corrosive thing to a volunteer effort.`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3677, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3676, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2325, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3673, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1917, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3397, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2440, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1459, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1868, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3453, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 38256961, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 38274499, "2": "  ::I scanned these photos from the Elson book on a flatbed scanner.

As the series ended with him dying, and didn't show him reawakening, there is no ``argument.`` Just people telling the truth and others twisting it.`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1983, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 677, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2262, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2274, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2687, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2941, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3046, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3294, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3299, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1982, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 1.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 38886310, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 38916372, "2": "I couldn't really expand on the third and fourth episodes due to time restraints.

The reason why, in general, is that the study of history is typically restricted to the era of 'written records', as the Wikipedia article on ``History`` will even state.  There can be probably some fudging, because written records can date slightly earlier events or have relation to slightly earlier events.  In short, history and pre-history will be divided by written records.  Please take a look at the wikipedia article on History of England, in that, the upper-right table indicates prehistory is before 43 BC, and history in the years after.  This date of 43 BC is generally due to Roman era records.  And again, (somewhere geographicaly closer to Japan) in the article History of China, the article begins by saying that ``The history of China is detailed by historical records dating back to 1500 BC``.   I think it's a bit problematic and misleading to state that history began 100,000 years ago, because if by history you mean purely archaeological evidence, then why stop there?  History will blend right into pre-history, and then into archaeology, without any meaningful demarcation.    There is the more casual usage of the word 'history', of course.  That is, history is just the sequence of all events from beginning to end.  In which case, the history of Japan goes back to the Big Bang and all time afterward.  But as an informative and scholarly Wikipedia entry, I think this article should be amended with something more accurate, more specific, referring to what is canonically defined as ``history``.  I propose something like   ``The earliest records of Japan date back to 600 B.C.E., according to the Chinese source commonly known as the  Gishiwajinden, or the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms.  In the text, the country of Yamataikoku is mentioned, which was said to be ruled by the Queen Himiko.``  I think this adds to the quality of the article in its specificity, and in exposing the reader to the Himiko story.  Even here, there is lots of controversy as to whether Yamataikoku even existed because of lack of archaeological evidence.  The idea that we have any idea of the specific events of 100,000 BCE, as the word 'history' demands, is somewhat unreasonable.

The result of the discussion was keep.  An archived record of this discussion can be found here.  |}  == More useful info == A voice chat session was conducted soon after the episode 7 release, during which the pure pwnage crew answered questions from fans around the globe. There was quite a bit of interesting info to gain from listening to recordings of the chat session. Some of this info should probably be worked into the article here. One such recording is currently at http://chigau.com/ppchat-edited.mp3 Another artifact related to the show would be Anastasia's blog. However, I cannot ascertain the true nature of this blog (whether it's Anastasia's 'real' blog, or just a prop set up for the show). Despite the fact that it is claimed to be the real blog, during the chat session mentioned above, I find it hard to believe the claim, due to the language used throughout the blog itself.  July 5, 2005 12:27 (UTC) : You can bet your life it's not real ;-)  : The fact that the blog mentions Jeremy being put in the hospital for playing WoW is an obvious give away that the blog is purely fictional.   :: Don't be so sure. That's how I felt until I started looking around a bit more. Listen to the chat, read the blog, browse some of their forums. Now I'm not so sure. Considering that the blog starts before the sixth episode it seems pretty real and the way they keep mentioning on the forums that when they have PP meets people can't belive how close to the truth the show is.  ::: It's fiction, partly based on real life. Come on, if you think PP is really happening watch the 9th episode. -someonelse: well actually, i agree with aupajo. I'm not saying that people can shoot micro, or that  dave used to be some kind of micro warrior, but its possible that the crew used to act like they do in the first couple episodes, and changed their ways.  == Reviews of Pure Pwnage ==  ; by Anonymous (67.140.145.26): Essentially Jeremy embodies the very scum of online gaming in a package that is all too familiar.  Pathetic vocabulary skills, general lack of anything resembling cultural knowledge, and the lifestyle of the perpetual slacker round out the package nicely.  This is, unfortunately, what most people think of when you say 'gamer' unless you're talking about the pen and paper variety, which has it's own features (among them, the thankful lacking of the word ``n00b``) that set it apart.  All in all I think this is a good parody of the gamer lifestyle, but unfortunately the misguided masses of preteens will attempt to emulate it further than they do on their own.  Online gaming is bad enough these days without stirring up that particular cesspool any more than needed.  In the end, it makes me yearn for the days of my youth when Quake's seperate online client was released.  Those were days when people would actually have intelligent conversation until the server filled up enough for a good game of CTF. (and that was before there even WAS a flag... it was a key)  Now, it's all n00b fagz0rz l0ll0rz!!!11!!!1one and corpse humping until you get bored and leave.  I can only hope that this scathing satire of that type of behavior will help show new gamers how NOT to act.  ::and what, may i ask, does this pov have to do with wikipedia?   :::Not much, if not anything.

I see that someone with no sense of humor took away your personal ad for your Mom.  However, the 16th is almost over anyway.  As far as murderers, commemorating their birth dates seems rather silly.  It would be more fitting to commemorate their death dates.  Like for example, the day that John Gacy was fried for killing 33 kids after raping and torturing them, the big meanie.  Actually, he was euthanized, but it was a day of macabre celebration regardless.    In revenge, I edited the reverter's user page. (didn't remove anything; only added on.)

I'd hate for draconian admins to rule the site, so I hope he's fair.  == ``Supershadow`` the next Director? ==  I read that George Lucas will direct Season 1, and ``hand it off`` to someone else during Seasons 2-4 (not sure what it said exactly). I think I read somewhere that a ``Supershadow`` will direct 2-4, and perhaps even film sequels (Episodes 7-9). Please post to  if you have any pertinent information. :SuperShadow is one of the biggest liars on the net. He has made hundreds of claims since the beginning of the prequels claiming he is friends with George Lucas himself. Shadow has even contradicted himself many times. The guy seems to really enjoy lying to the star wars community. There won't be a 7, 8, or 9, either directed by Lucas or SuperShadow, just this TV series. SuperShadow is just some loser named Mickey Suttle. He is hated at the worst level by most of us fans who know the truth behind his lies. Check out Supershadow for more information on this moron.    == Ashley Nicholls ==  I can verify the name for you. I have several programmes with his name in.    == Siheung ==  If you were at Siheung train station, then you probably were not in Siheung Si. You would probably have been in Siheung Dong, which is in Seoul. I live in the city called Siheung with has no train station and is just outside of Bucheon.    == Star Wars and requests ==  (Re: Wikipedia talk:Most wanted articles)  The easiest thing to do if you think an article should be created is to create it and then mark it as a stub.  Otherwise, you can list your request on a subpage of Wikipedia:Requested articles.  But all the Star Wars movies, of course, already have articles.  See the bottom of Star Wars for links.  If you type in the title you think an article should have, and you don't see that article, you can create a redirect to aid future readers.     == Exameter roads ==  Yes, I got the gist.  The key difference is, all indications are they're not at all notable.     :No, happily the standard isn't quite so high as that. )  Some 'general use' of the term/concept would probably be sufficient.  (Lots of independent google hits, that sort of thing.)     There's no magic number of google hits.

Sorry, as a non-expert, non-German speaker (like most English-speaking Wiki readers), these two powerful ships - as equipped - were less than battleships (for whatever reason), and were not intended to be used as such by the Kriegsmarine. They were, I suggest, intended to see off cruiser escorts and destroy convoys. To me, to call them ``battleships`` is confusing - they were not the equal of the ``Bismarcks`` nor even of the ``KG5s``. They certainly had the capability to be upgraded to ``proper`` battleships, it was a design feature and, I think, work did start on the Gneisenau.   I accept that the German term ``Schlachtkreuzer`` translates directly into ``battleship``, so what? This is the English language Wiki and should convey meaning to English speakers. ``Battlecruisers`` were at a disadvantage to ``battleships``: see Hood and Scharnhorst - and to me, that's the point. Perhaps English/ German understandings of the term have diverged, and it's a language issue. After all the Graf Spee, Scheer and Lutzow/ Deutschland have had differing descriptions in English (``pocket battleship`` or ``heavy cruiser``) and German (``panzerschiff``).  I had thought that the accepted way forward was to explain the differing views, when appropriate.

WNRI finds this fact to be extremely inconvenient because advertisers know that an 18-watt night signal won't get their message out as far as they'd like.  Wikipedia is not here to help WNRI sell advertising.  Furthermore, saying that this station is in the ``Providence market`` is a total fabrication.  Driving around the Providence city limits with a car radio, WNRI's signal is unreliable at best.  Home radios don't pick it up well either.  Again, this is being added to the article to help WNRI get advertising.  By saying that they're in the ``Providence market``, it makes the station look more attractive to advertisers.  Again, Wikipedia is not here to help WNRI sell advertising.  I can verify that  is indeed an employee of the station, as I've met him personally once.  I don't think he's doing this to be spiteful, I think he's doing it because management is asking him to.  Radio is a very cut-throat business and most station managers believe that ANY publicity is bad publicity, especially when the publicity includes facts that could be detrimental to selling advertising.   `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 358, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 359, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 504, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1260, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1893, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2030, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2028, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2175, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2197, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1966, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 41167177, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 41176338, "2": "  == Please disambiguation ECN ==  in the IPv4#Header diagram, there's a link to ECN, which is a dab page.

Well I say this logic leads to only one outcome, the articles purpose is to argue the point which is a violation of NPOV.  1.

Deleting the criticism on the grounds that the article needs to be improved suggests the only way to improve the article is by aruging the point. Again, violation of NPOV. 3.  Criticism does not put undo weight on negatives. Again the purpose of the article is not to argue the point of progressivism but to report the facts. 4.  The fact is criticism exists and it should be reported.  The criticism section included an AUthor and his book. 5.  The addition of a pov original research counter arguement to the criticism further proves my point (And you can look on the history page) that they believe the purpose of the article is to argue the point rather than report the facts.

Dispite these citations, he deleted the material on the grounds that what he believes is the truth does not fit the facts provided.  He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).  This is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.  The logic is poor.  The citation is non existant.  The pov is massive.  Slizor's edit needs a massive revert...and he needs to be drawn away from his computer and beaten with Milton Friedman and FA Hayek books until he understands the quotes from their books that he deleted.

My thought experiment has gotten you all fired up, it seems. -)  In the case of the Trouton-Noble experiment, all the interactions involved are electromagnetic interactions. So once a theoretician has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformations apply, things can be taken from there. Now, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted.  === Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to? ===   But does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? If gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. This is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relativity. Something has to give.  This theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordstr\u00f6m's Lorentz invariant scalar theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relativity, and a successor to special relativity is needed. (And was provided by Einstein.)   Poincar\u00e9's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincar\u00e9 demands gravitational-inertial mass equivalence as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincar\u00e9 had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so.  I think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertial mass. When light propagates from an emitter to a receiver, it not only transmits momentum, it also transmits inertial mass. The inertial mass of the emitter decreases on emission of the light, and the inertial mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity.  Possibly, considerations of this nature made Poincar\u00e9 very, very cautious towards attributing inertial mass to energy.   In his 1909 G\u00f6ttingen lecture, Poincar\u00e9 went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the electrons. Can that still work for muons and tauon's? My understanding is that electrons and muons are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should electrons and muons become more and more alike at higher velocities? To my knowledge: at all velocities the energy of muons is the muon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor.  I am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. As you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relativity.  |  ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1039, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1143, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1239, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1358, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1456, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 997, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 819, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1413, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 29, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 967, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 1.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 41956431, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 41960957, "2": "  == Wikibreak ==  You're on a wikibreak??

I am terribly sorry about this. I do occasionally fail to notice things like this at first, and have to go back and revert myself, but I really should have noticed this by the third time.

My comment above is only *explanation*.  Sigh. Here again is what I want to put in the article. It's on my talk page. Sigh:  ``1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning ``short sword``; confusion about the derivation of ``Shotokan`` may occur otherwise. The Kanji for shoto, ``pine waves``, is (\u677e\u6d9b). The first character is (\u677e), which means pine tree. The second character (\u6d9b) is a kanji variant of (\u6fe4), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (\u5c0f\u5200). The first character is (\u5c0f), meaning small, and the second character is (\u5200), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw ``\u677e\u6d9b`` would not mistake it.``  You say that you do not *agree* with this, but you cannot seem to explain what is *wrong* with it. It would make no claim whatsoever, when posted in the article, to any reasonable person, that the ``short sword`` story is being told out there (even though it is; I just don't have it in a book for you, so I'm not trying to claim it on Wikipedia). It can be looked at as *preemptively* preventing confusion.  For someone who says he wants to work together, you are laying down a lot of conditions. I think it is reasonable to say at least:  ``1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning ``short sword``. The Kanji for shoto, ``pine waves``, is (\u677e\u6d9b). The first character is (\u677e), which means pine tree.

Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a ``personal attack,`` and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.

I would appreciate it if you could explain the problem and what I can expect.  Please see also my recent edit of Arrow's impossibility theorenm.  My regards,  Thomas Colignatus   DRAFT  To the president of MIT Professor Susan Hockfield http://web.mit.edu/hockfield/ hockfield@mit.edu  To the dean of SIMS, University of California at Berkeley Professor Hal Varian http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hal/ hal@sims.berkeley.edu   March 11, 2006    Dear professors Hockfield and Varian, Dear Hal,  I have a problem on the integrity of science with two of your students, Rob Speer at MIT who started the problem, and Joseph Lorenzo Hall at SIMS who is interfering in an unhelpful way. The problem is summarized in the appendix.  Obviously, the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academics so there must be a great deal of tolerance with students. With students, they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can, and they are only learning the trade. Yet, students e.g. know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. When issues of integrity arise, it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. In this case, these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity.  In the present case, the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet, in particular wikipedia. It appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. My reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat.  It is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. My impression is that this relation exists. Firstly, they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of MIT and SIMS, thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there, implying their relation to you. Secondly, they are active in editing work, where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. Their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. This is most clearly so with Joseph Lorenzo Hall who is already a Ph.D. student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. For Rob Speer, who started the problem, it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose.  In the end, it is with", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4011, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 461, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2807, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -2.0, "wi": 3965, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 844, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 434, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1574, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3999, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 405, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3745, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 43339869, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 43356985, "2": "`   ==Image Tagging Image:GaylordCeiling2.jpg==  {| align=``CENTER``  style=``background-color:#FFFFFF; border:8px solid #FF0000;  padding:5px;`` |- | | This media may be deleted.  |}  Thanks for uploading Image:GaylordCeiling2.jpg.

The article on the rock band uses the phase ``lethal name like DDT`` which indicates an anti-DDT bias on the part of the writer; there is no evidence to suggest that DDT is lethal to humans except in large doses. Without this comment I would have classified it as irrelevant.  You rejected the comment ``However, if the media presentation of a particular issue is biased towards one side of that issue, he inevitably appears to be biased towards the other, and consequently attracts criticism from the supporters of that side of the issue.`` as being NPOV. I have shown that, where media presentation in the issue of DDT is biased towards one side of the issue he appears to be biased towards ther other. So as far as DDT is concerned this statement is NPOV, and you have no reason for removing it other than to try and make the paragraph appear more critical of him. In fact, in trying to characterise his view as being biased you are adding your own POV to the paragraph.

There are accounts of Panchanon Bhattacarya as well as Tincouri and Ducouri Lahiri handing prayaschitta money directly to Babaji, and also a personal visit of Babaji to the house of Lahiri Mahasaya witnessed by Pranavananda. So it is somewhat safe to conclude that Mahavatar Babaji was a ``normal`` human being intermingling with people in civilization, though probably exaggerated thru time.

For doing this, I am using the revert closest to the original FA article as a template along with the other religion pages.  It is proving to be easier than I originally thought as closer look shows a lot of repeats. *2) Then over the next few days, I plan on going thorugh every ``dodgy`` reference and make sure it is upto the wikipedia standard.  If not, I will remove it and replace it with a valid reference.  Luckily, I have great access to lot of related scholarly articles + lot of time.  Also, I am hoping others to pitch in ofcourse. *3) I also have a long term goal based on your suggestion to round up some permanent editors for the article.  Their jobs will be to make sure stuff does not creep in + a long term goal of further improving the references.

It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this:   ``A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the ``cut-off`` for Category 4.``  For the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.  Listen to me very carefully. Beauty may fade, but dumb is forever.   `", "6": [{"ts": -1.0, "wi": 343, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 975, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 9, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1507, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 512, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 219, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1515, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 92, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1516, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 197, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 44889728, "tg": 0.3}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 44929823, "2": "  ==reverting==  it's tiresome when one corrects bad grammer etc and reversion restores it. wikipedia's standards in this department are low enough already.

Make sure you stick to that in the future. Additionally, adding the 'unsourced' tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate. A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources, not 0, as the tag implys.``  Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him (with the exception of ``to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians``, which, as I explained later in the same section, any person assuming good faith would take as an insult). You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of ``we discuss articles, not users``????   As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided.   I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of ``Iranian peoples`` - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative. I'd consider any advice or mediation.

No matter what happens here I'm going to be filing an RfC demanding an investigation into this. It looks to me like this user has a history of blocking people for unnecessary reasons. Like I said this is unacceptable. I called that person a troll because he was indeed using provocative language (pointing me out by name and then asking me to ``review WP:CIVIL`` for making an edit he doesn't like), and I did not threaten him with a block - I was referring to his block on Iranian peoples for violating 3RR. This is unacceptable.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 7, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 228, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1428, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3047, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 562, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 3043, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 757, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2164, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2112, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1160, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 1.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 45971922, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 45974726, "2": "  : I don't understand.

It is a Prince of Gerona, but never was Catalu\u00f1a a Principado. Stop trying to be what you are not. You may be proud of some other things, but neither you have ever been a Kingdom, not a Principado, nor you have had a clasic literature in catal\u00e1n.

I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link  :I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here. :I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier ``greatest site ever!`` type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons: :#Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that. :#No Google hit within the first 100 links in a ``pink floyd`` search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites. :#The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos. :#Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account. :#The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try). :That's my 2\u00a2 on this particular site. - a   ::I'll double 's 2\u00a2 and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.    ::I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states ``Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)`` this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself.

If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

A province really does not have a monetary policy (though it can do some things e. g. about the availability of cash) and the phrase was too general to begin with, so that's gone. I changed ``did nothing to stop`` to ``did not work to stop``, though your criticism is valid. Note however that, when De la R\u00faa took office, Argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it, and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start. Then came the corralito, etc. On the whole, the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the IMF were recommending them. I don't remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. Note also that ``economic collapse`` doesn't refer only to the critical period November 2001 - February 2002, but to the whole recessive period (1999-2002) and some time before and after. We should agree on a phrase that links De la R\u00faa's measures with the crisis without falling into any of: :#``... did not work to stop the economic collapse.`` :#``... ended up precipitating the economic collapse.`` :#``... ultimately caused the economic collapse.`` :#``... were intended to cause the economic collapse.`` (!!) :#``... had nothing to do with the economic collapse`` (!!!) :Then the ``import-dependent`` thing. Consider this: right after the devaluation, neighboring countries had to help us get medicine. The public hospital where I worked initially could not get X-ray film from the providers, and then only by paying in cash (and in dollars). Argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology. I'd say that's rather import-dependent, though we may be speaking of different things. What do you propose? :What's the problem with the religious aspects of the Supreme Justices? The previous justices were all old, male, and ideologically conservative, and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the Catholic Church. And now two of them are women, one is the president of the Court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words. The clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the Supreme Court were really important. Argibay's atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media. In a country where the Church attacks anyone who dares speak of women's rights, having these two women at the top of one of the country's government branches is extremely significant. :The qualification ``historical`` for the payment to the IMF is that (correct me if I'm wrong) Argentina had never decided to pay so much to the IMF or anyone else, not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule; and this payment has re-defined the relationship of Argentina with the IMF and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment. :I'm glad we're discussing this here civilly.

Thus, there's no reason a band like The Pogues - who sung frequently about Irish matters - should be considered less Celtic simply because they were focused on the present.

I was giving suggestions for the article before, but people began attacking me. So I defended myself. But they did not get a warning. But regardless, I think that the current article is very good. Maybe it can be broadened up to include the various definitions the term Islamism takes from different people. Very differnt definitions are applied to the term as shown in the sources. I also think that the history section should be removed. It lists Islamic groups as Islamist movements based on opinion and it has nothing to do with the term. I think that the history section should focus more on the evolution of the term. The different stages it went through, for example, the term was first used in french to just refer to Islam.

I have already seen the articles on them without any success in understanding the difference. Aren't GFDL documents open to public use? All the images created by me are tagged , but I don't have any idea if  would be more appropriate or not.  Secondly, I couldn't understand the context of your saying ``IITB also has a geology department. Please check.`` Even if it does have one, where should the changed be made, if at all they are to be done since this is a very minor issue.

I suggest that a possible compromise is that we should add that the Kosovar Albanian goverment refuses the Belgrade suzeiranity and considers it not a part of Serbia, and then the other side of the story (Serbia & the world), however, pointing it not an official part of Serbia and Montenegro is, francly, I apologize for the expression, but it is, really nonsensical. Hope that you will solve the case!

Returning to the discussion about the coint,,,uhhh guys Hannibal is Phoenician(Caanite,Yemen Migrents) Caanite(yemen Migrents Berber(yemen Migrents) Carthaginian Arab  Berbers:   Berbers are the original and first inhabitants of North-Africa, in other words, they are the natives of this part of Africa. The name by which they are called (berbers) comes from the noun ``barbarians`` (in english). And this, because Romans used to call All those who didn't speak their language  ``barbarians``... And actually, there are only us who are still called like this ^_~ why did they use this term, they just use this noun without any feeling of a pejorative meaning. But to call themeselves in their language (Tamazight), they use ``imazighen``: the plural of ``Amazigh``.   Many people ask about our origins, and I always say that this question is sensless! it's like asking what is the origins of the Indians! Indians Don't have the same eyes as chinese but they are considered as asians so Just think about us (it's an order!) that We are berbers Thus we are Africans!   Don't forget that those who first were called africans were berbers, when you study about Rome and byzantine at school, you've probably heard about carthage and africans? these africans were the great Phoenicians,Berbers (arabs). Hence the Carthaginian Arabs.   But we can answer to which race the berbers belong to, As you know (I'm sure you don't know!^^') there are 3 races in the world:   The Caucasoid race (Europeans, Jews/hebrews, Arabs ...etc.)   The Negroid Race. (Blacks)   The Mongloid Race. (chinese, japanese ...etc.)   Berbers are predominately Caucasoid (berbers of the sahara are mixed with sub-saharans), Their language is close to the Language spoken by the old egyptians (Pharaohs...), in other words they speak an Afro-asiatic language (Hebrew, Arab, assyrian, Old egyptian, Berber...etc.) SEMETIC! XD   To see how berbers look like click google   To know how berber language sounds (through music) download this MP3 by clicking google   The lands where berbers lived in the past, were from the west of Old Egypt to the Canary-islands, But now, Berbers constitute only 25% of the population in Algeria and 40% in morocco, the berbers of the canary islands (called guanches) are spanish now and they've lost their language.

YIPEEE p   Here is the Berber DNA compared to other ethnics:   ``So far, our analyses have allowed a clear dissection of almost all NW African...paternal lineages into several components with distinct historical origins. In this way, the historical origins of the NW African Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 75% NW African Upper Paleolithic (H35, H36, and H38), 13% Neolithic (H58 and H71), 4% historic European gene flow (group IX, H50, H52), and 8% recent sub-Saharan African (H22 and H28).`` (Bosch et al., Am J Hum Genet, 2001) * * * Caucasoid mtDNA (maternal) sequences, labeled L3E and U6, were detected at frequencies of 96% in Moroccan Berbers, 82% in Algerian Berbers and 78% in non-Berber Moroccans, compared with only 4% in a Senegalese population. (Rando et al., Ann Hum Genet, 1998) * * *   While the origins of the Sumerians, whose language appears related to no known linguistic family, remain a mystery, the other people of the region were chiefly Semites - Canaanites (the Levant), Amorites (southwestern desert people), Akkadians and Assyrians (Mesopotamia), Arameans, Habiru (Hebrews) and Bedu (Beduin Arabs of the southern desert). The languages of these groups are closely related, and also related more distantly to Hamitic languages, which include ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian.  Throughout the Bronze Age there was a sporadic influx of nomads from Arabia into the area, hostile at first, but soon incorporated into the existing culture. Later, Indo-European peoples migrated into the area. Among them were the Hurrians, who moved from Turkey in the North to Iraq in the 3rd milleneum BCE and brought the light horse-drawn chariot and composite b", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1028, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1183, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1189, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 81, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 720, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1935, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1990, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2017, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2036, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1265, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 48222340, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 48225254, "2": "   It wasn't me, my brother was using the comp. - ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1271, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3173, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3140, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2826, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1276, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1275, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1274, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1273, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1017, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1267, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 48225254, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 48226431, "2": "Die I just wanted to tell you that i hate you, and i fucked your mother. she told me about how you ass-raped her, and i do not approve. however, due to your homosexual tendansies, ill let it slide.

Obviously, you premies don't like it but the fact is, it's apparent beyond question that Geaves has misrepresented the truth about Rawat's role in the Millenium hype.  Geaves said:  :In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.  Whereas, in a broadly-disseminated letter to all his followers, Rawat described the upcoming program as the ``most Holy and significant event in human history``, intimated that the festival wasn't just for him and his followers but the whole world, ``and maybe the whole universe`` and suggested that it was time for his followers to help him ``bring peace to this Earth.``  Any fair reader can clearly see the serious discrepancy between Geaves' account and the documentary evidence.`", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1222, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 822, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1177, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1176, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1441, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1447, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1874, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3935, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2443, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1433, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 48382261, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 48411825, "2": "Could you move your  to Commons?", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2919, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2644, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2494, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3900, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1101, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 393, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3673, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3894, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1460, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3271, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 48411825, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "random"}, {"1": 48419904, "2": "  == SuperDeng ==  Do something about him.

It was one of many allegations of photo manipulation dismissed by the HSCA. You want to mention it as if 1) it was never debunked 2) it's the most important thing ever 3) it is proof of conspiracy.      ::Gamaliel, none of the three things you just wrote make any logical sense. 1)Some believe the chin is not a fabrication. So what? This doesn't mean these true believers have ``debunked`` something. Its their opinion. The policy of this web site is to provide all opinions, and certainly not to hide the evidence. When are you going to understand this rule? 2) How important is it? It is relevant to Oswald's contention that some one was framing him. Whether that is the ``most important thing ever' is up to the reader. 3) Whether it is proof of a conspiracy is also up to the reader.   Gamaliel, your frantic attempts to delete and hide any information that you disagree with is directly contrary to the web site rules. Why do you continue to do it?    ::Don't forget, there were two Oswald's. Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald. One worked for the CIA and was the real triggerman, I forget which... But wait a minute, the fatal shot really came from the grassy knoll, from an anti-Castro Cuban, who wanted payback, for no air-support for Brigade 2506, during the Bay of Pigs disaster... No wait a minute Oswald was a paid hitman for the mafia...... oh well It's 3:37 in the AM, all this conspiracy stuff is making me loopy. Goodnight. ::   :::Gamaliel, is this person above who calls himself ``Mytwocents`` your alter ego, and put in for comic relief?     ==Web site rules of inclusion of all significant viewpoints==  ::::The evidence of the fabricated photograph is a significant viewpoint that was discussed in the HSCA report. Some experts believe it shows fabricationsome don't. Under the rules of this web site all significant viewpoints should be presented.   *Claiming that someone else disagrees with a significant viewpoint on a subject is not a ground for excluding it from the article.   *Arguing it is not the ``most important thing ever`` is not a ground for excluding the view point that the photographs are fabrications.   *Arguing that evidence that the photographs were fabricated is evidence of a conspiracy,  is not a ground for excluding the evidence.

It seems to me that the only way of rendering a neutral article is to state that Oswald was arrested and held on suspicion of Kennedy's murder, but was killed before he could be tried.  It can then be provably stated that the Warren Commission, in its Report, concluded that Oswald was guilty and had worked alone, but that there have since been many efforts and arguments that attempt to disprove this conclusion.

It is not a separate process, most sociologists and linguist call the shared cultural region as Tamilakam. In Wiki we have to rewrite the article to reflect this reality. If you read the Kerala and Malayalam entries, and www.kerlahistory.com site this new idea is brought out. Hence Kerala and Tamil Nadu are hitched at the hips up-until the 10 century regarding their cultural development.   ::Caste itself is not a proper word to describe the social condition of South Asia. What is more accurate is Jati and Varna.  According to linguists like Proff Hart of Berkeley and others, indigenous societies specifically in South India there already were societal cleavage based on certain lineages that were slowly cornering certain economic productive mechanisms such as cultivation, fishing, security, drumming, bards etc. This was in response to a move away from hunter gatherers to slash and burn to settled agriculture and cattle herding.   ::The Sangam literature which is a kaleidoscope of the social conditions prevalent in ancient Cera, Chola and Pandya countries describes a situation where there was a lot of flux and violence used to maintain the economic advantages. In this milieu the northern ideas and people were also added their system such as the Varna. But in reality what the Brahmins  did was to become just another Jati to fit the local model already prevailing and added religious sanction on top of the violence that is needed to maintain the Jati system . Thus  Brahminism, Jainism and Buddhism were  very important in pacifying the populace that lead to the development of later great empires.   ::The word Pulaiti and Pulayan are used in Sangam literature to describe people serving chiefs. They were attached to the wealthy because apparently they were dispossessed or had nothing to independably live on. The name of the Kannadiga caste is Holeya. Where Hole in archaic Kannada means menstrual blood thus indicating that even before Tamil and Kannada became independent certain lineages may have become debased. As you know that\u2019s a long time ago:))   ::Why is ancient Tamilakam important as opposed to rest of India to understand the unique caste system. Because it was the last frontier to succumb to Indo Aryan population and cultural advance into South Asia.

(I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale, but he would die of shock. I have done enough damage already; I fear he may need long-term therapy.)  Anyway, I was banned for this unspeakable language, and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame. I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page. I fear he may revert both, and delete this message, but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JedRothwell I quote Schiller's warning: ``Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens.`` ('Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.') (Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6). Hence, the title of this message.  Thick-skinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly:  :. . . If you would like a reason to block me, or prove that I have violated the rules, you need not preserve the talk page. Here is another deliberate & intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an old-school personal insult:  :You are a loathsome, sanctimonious, hypocritical, ignorant twit. If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion, I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them.  :I hope that is satisfactory.  That goes for you, too, Mr. . . uh, Chihuahua \u2013 isn\u2019t it? Bow wow! Ruff! Grrrrr . . . Consider yourself gravely insulted. If this were the 18th century you might challenge me to a duel, but since I am a craven bounder, I would, of course, run away instead of accepting. Believe me, I am trying to get away, without success so far.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1848, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1912, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1877, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 538, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1833, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1742, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1620, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1853, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1476, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1569, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 1.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 50620232, "tg": 0.3}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 50628497, "2": "  Jimmy D'Allessio can't rasp for his LIFE!

The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.     The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)  Secondly, in the split article section, the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect, its an article about how the sect is impacting the world.  It just seems a bit more accurate.     Hopefully i will have a viable solution setup after i do some more reading about editing etc...

In order to prevent that and keep each side on it's country pages ), you admins and bureucrats should carefully and ACTIVELY treat the issue of pro-Russian propaganda.

Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally ``no one``. In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to ``no one``. It is impossible to say ``no one are dinosaurs``. It has to be ``no one is a dinosaur``. Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding ``none`` to ``no one`` does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that ``none`` is a synonym for ``nothing``.

Wal-Mart does not spend as much on insurance as other companies.  The fact. Yes Wal-Mart spends less per work for health.  The Twist. What they forget to say is that Wal-Mart does not buy insurance at  all, it puts that money into a bank account, where it collects interest, it then contracts Blue Cross to admin the fund.   The reality. Wal-Mart gives better insurance than most other retailers.  Want to see for yourself go to your local walmart and get an assocate guide.  2. Wal-Mart does not supply as many with healthcare.  The fact. Yes on a percentage base Wal-Mart only 47% are covered.  The Twist. What critics don't tell you is that Wal-Mart offers Star Bridge health from day one, and that wal-mart has 1.6 million Workers with a larger turn over rate, so this leads to a lower percentage of works covered.  3. Wal-Mart has a high turn over rate.  The Fact. Wal-Mart does have a high turn over rate.  The Twist. Critics Site Wal-Mart as the reason, however most of people that leave walmart site customer related stress. And the area of walmart that has the highest turn over is also the largest pool of workers, cashiers. Plain and simple the customers run the cashiers out. And who can blame them think of all the people in the world you could not stand, and they deal with them all everyday.  4. Wal-Mart has more workers on state healthcare than any other company.  The Fact. Yes wal-mart does have more works on state healthcare.  The Twist. Critics argue that due to the number of workers on state healthcare is single handedly causing problems for many state healthcare,however what they forget to say is that Walmart pays 70 Billion dollars in federal taxes and nearly that again in state taxes and also generate billions of dollars in sales tax for each state with sales tax,which far out does the money spend buy the state on healthcare for wal-mart assocates. And many of the assocates that quilify for state aided healthcare also would quailify for welfare if they did not work for walmart. And would most likely be on both if they worked for a smaller ma and pa shop, that could not afford to supply any benefits.   5. Wal-mart buys large quantities from china  The Fact Yes walmart buys a lot from china.  The Twist Critics argue that Walmart alone is the primary reason for US jobs being exported, however what they fail to say is that walmart is only 8% of the use Retail market, and 70% of walmarts income if from food sales and 90% of walmarts food supply comes from local and national suppliers, like con-agra. When broken down walmart sends a mear penny to china out of ever transaction. something much larger than walmart is helping china out.   Now these are just 5 of the biggest twisted facts, there are many more out there, both good and bad for walmart, walmart does its share of fact twisting too. However I have seen almost no hard research here on any of the facts being relied on. I have alot of hard proof of lots of these twisted facts but I can not be the only one out looking for the twistes in the facts. And I also am not going to post any of the proofs until others start, because I want everyone here to start doing some research and finding some real reliable facts that we can bring this entry back to a good standing. But we must work together to do that, not against eachother.

I don't try to bash my city or say it's a bad place, and contrary to how i feel, the city actually HAS been getting better in recent years (2003-now), despite crime rates increasing somewhat.

Windsor's main issues for crime are assaults, threats, and burglary/ Break-And-Enter (B&E;).  Now, one might get confused when they say ``but coonfox, you just said it has the highest crime rate!`` True, we do per capita. We have more Break-And-Enters and convenience store robberies than any other city in canada when adjusted to population. Overall, though, Toronto, Ontario and Metro Detroit still beat us, since they have around 4 million people each (20x our population).

The original Semitic people came from Arabia, they moved north and east. After time, the Semitic people devised many dialects of ``Semitic``. Those dialects became known as ``Languages`` after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab.

As the result of an arbitration case, he posted these words on a talk page: ``Lou_franklin is banned from editing this article...  The user is not prevented from discussing or proposing changes on this talk page.``    Since it explicitly said ``The user is not prevented from discussing or proposing changes``, I did.  As a result he blocked me for 48 hours!  He apparently made a mistake posting the wording because he changed it to ``the user is prevented`` after he blocked me.  Obviously since the talk pages said I am ``not prevented from discussing or proposing changes``, it is not appropriate to ban me for doing so!  Other users (above) suggested to him that he ``ask for clarification at the relevant ArbCom page`` and ``I think it is advisable to ask clarification`` and ``since the template was misleading, the block should probably be lifted``, but he flatly refused saying ``there is nothing to clarify...  Specific rulings overrule a general template.``   I asked him to post a link to the Wikipedia policy that states that.  He could not provide one, and responded by saying ``you are rulelawyering``.  He said ``you should know better than to rely on a general template``.  When the 48 hour block was over, he blocked me again for a week!    This time he blocked for using the word ``homo`` on a talk page.  I didn't feel that the word ``homo`` was all that offensive.  A homo is ``someone who practices homosexuality`` (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=homo ), which is what we were talking about.  It comes from the Greek word which means ``same`` - as in same sex.  This admin is making up rules as he goes.  Once I am unblocked I will file a complaint against him, but since he still has me blocked I can't even do that.  I need intervention on two fronts: I need somebody to unblock me, and I need somebody to mentor John.  If an admin posts that it's OK for a user to add to the discussion, it's really not reasonable for the same admin to block the user for doing so.  Is there an admin here who would be able to explain that to John?  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4158, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4127, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3978, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3365, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3363, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 3186, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 134, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2095, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1625, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3181, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 52650189, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 52652033, "2": "  == Teamwork ==  I would be wikking to work with Kirill and other folks here on improving articles.

Thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. I find it very interesting. Her pictures of women's bodies as commodities are very disturbing, while her photos of Morrissey are beautiful. I really want to get my hands on the Morrissey Shot book, but I couldn't order it from amazon, apparently they can't ship it to my country.  Anyway, I know what you're talking about, information on Linder and Ludus is very hard to find. Besides the Ludus biography you quoted, I've come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in 2000: The Guardian article http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,138286,00.html and here is a long and in-depth article: http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/nov2001/manchester_voodoo.html  Her real name is Linda Mulvey. The Guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth (1954, Liverpool) and a bit on her background.  I have some pictures from Ludus sleeves that I might include in the article.  Besides The Importance of Being Morrissey, Linder also appeared in Southbank Show on The Smiths.   What other magazine articles have you found about her? She's usually mentioned in connection with Morrissey, and even that is very rarely. The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent ``The Face`` 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in ``The Severed Alliance``, but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in ``Songs That Saved Your Life`` - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: ``Oh Linder. Oh Linder. I'll see you sometime, somewhere.``   However, I'm not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article, for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again, it's not like Wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours (Morrissey page is one of the examples!) But it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so I don't know.    `", "6": [{"ts": -1.0, "wi": 4129, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 590, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2048, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2413, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3016, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3020, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3812, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3868, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4169, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 4173, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 52725824, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 52727834, "2": "`  ``Case swapping`` does exist.
