It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.    One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on ``the history of science`` would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.    I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.    I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.

That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first. James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula.   Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.  Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that. Most of us are fed up trying to explain to SM/DF where they are wrong, only to be ignored and blatently untrue rubbish dumped into articles. So we aren't been called rascists and nazis, big deal! SM/DF's behaviour is still way of the mark. It is as if Adam goes onto wiki with the basic approach of 'now where can I cause grief today?'.

Nice to meet you. You're doing a great job, especially if English isn't your first language. I'd hate to be editing in anything other than English.  Signing is done when you are editing a 'talk' page. When you are having a discussion it really helps to know who said what, and when. We always encourage people to sign whatever they write there. However in articles everything is considered 'common property'. We don't sign what we write, because we don't want to think that we 'own' it in any way; someone might come along and change it later. Once an article has been in existence for more than a few days there are usually many people who have contributed to it. In some cases there may be nothing left of what the first author wrote.  What a lot of people do is put a list of articles that they have made big contributions to on their own user page. That gives you an idea of what a person has done here without claiming 'ownership'.

Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing.

I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use.  :::Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda.   :::This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors. Maybe that pattern is changing, or not, but it's abberrant.  :::Enough.

The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant. That's why some of the creeds are quite amazingly pedantic.  It's also a non-sensical point of view. You can't believe a bunch of words devoid of underlying meaning. You either believe them as they were meant, you mis-interpret them and thus mis-believe them, or you pretend to believe them. But there is no such thing as believing them without having a modicum of understanding. Sure you can believe some words are ``from God`` but not know what they mean, but then you don't believe the doctrine you believe that there are some words that are true.  >If you read a few dozen explanations on the begottenness of the Son from a  >spectrum of historical and contemporary sources, including Augustine, you will  >not find that this doctrine is connected to theories of time, despite what the  >deleted section claims about these theories being the ``root`` of the doctrine.

Your today is eternity; therefore You begat the Co-eternal, to whom You said, 'This day have I begotten Thee.' Thou hast made all time; and before all times You are, nor in any time was there not time.``  Augustine directly links God being external to time with the begetting of the Son.

Since, I could sense an emotional outburst in your message, I thought it would be worth spending a few seconds calming you down )  Please be careful in your edits :Oh sure...Iam always careful. I do not send baseless assumptions as warning shots to anyone )   Regarding Radhanath Sikdar: I think you need to realize that Wikipedia is a collaborative work - we develop articles by consensus.  :Thanks for your enlightenment. Unfortunately someone already taught me this fact a long time ago when I first ventured into this wikipedia ) Thanks anyway.  Simply reverting edits is counter-productive and against the etiquette of the Wikipedia. :I think this is your POV! There is a 'revert to previous page' button. May be your highness should dismantle it.  Commonly, we iterate until we can find language and fact statements that are acceptable to everyone. Notice that this iteration isn't a ``reversion war`` - people discuss and change and adapt the article until consensus is reached. :Another POV again ) By the way - could you please enlighten me about who your 'we' refers to in all the above sentences?  Please explain why you are insisting on ``now called`` in the Sikdar article, or, for that matter, why you are insisting on the mention of the name ``Sagarmatha``. There may be a legitimate NPOV reason for the inclusion of both - without explanation, I am assuming that it is motivated by Hindu nationalism.  :I must appreciate your exceptional ability to assume things. Fortunately, I am not a religious fanatic. But, I do know that provocative sentences like this fuel hatred and anger in the hearts of those groups you mentioned. Again I may be wrong. You know all ) But, I do feel that there is no 'present day sun' or 'present day moon'. That was the only impetus behind my editing it. Besides I also thought that there is nothing wrong in representing a fact (name 'sagarmatha'). Again you know all.   My assumption very well may be incorrect, but no explanation of your reversion has been given. Convince me. :I confirm that your assumption is not only untrue but is provocative and preposterous. Sometimes even highly intelligent people like you do mistakes )  Note that the original name of Presidency College (in Calcutta, founded in 1817) was ``Hindoo College``. Not ``Hindu`` (as in the religion). Please stop reverting. It seems to me that if you insist on using one of the original names of Mount Everest, for consistency you must also use the original name of the college. Convince me otherwise. :As far as I could remember, I have been taught that the right spelling is Hindu, in India. Could you please let me know the difference between Hindoo and Hindu? By the way, could your highness ) please let me know how you assumed that I am an Hindu? I again appreciate your astrological prowess! Astrology is many a times fake - just fyi your highness )  :I do not know why messages like this from people who know everything, makes me a little sad sometimes. I am envious of the brilliant people like you who can assume a boat load of stuff with just a two-line edit!

First, whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly ``where Smith lived.``  (I'll explain why I think that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used ``the`` seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the ``fashionably elite Protestant clergy`` (whatever that means, which probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a first-hand witness.  I honestly don't have a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:  :a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph's residential area. :b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him. :c. i. Whether the term ``fashionably elite`` is remotely relevant to the article. :c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least.   2. ``the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. was raised`` is facially inaccurate.  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:  ``that campaign also took place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.``   3. ``Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies.``  A rather strong claim , and I don't mind keeping it in, but it should be on the following conditions: 1. ``earliest`` be quantified to a given year, and ``Christian`` quanitified to a sect of the time. 2. We add the following text from Hugh Nibley's ``The World and the Prophets,`` which tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies: :``Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There are some Christ-betrayers... They introduce God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens he says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known.`` (page 55) :``The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...but is indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begotten...'`` (page 55)   4. ``Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Young's doctrine that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body``, like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his Incarnation.``  The word incarnation doesn't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.  I recommend we change that to say:  ``The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body,`` like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his mortal birth.``   5. ``He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject, pondering, and praying to God for an answer. As Smith's teachings evolved, his later teachings painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son with physical celestial bodies, being one in purpose together with the Holy Spirit.``  I think the first sentence is out of place (read it in context to see my meaning).  I'd like to clarify the second sentence; it could be understood that Smith's teaching's regarding the Godhead changed rather than expanded.  I'd like to reword as follows:  ``As Smith's teachings about God expanded they gradually painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son than that of other churches, with each possessing a physical, purified body, being one in purpose with the Holy Ghost.``  (As a side note, the phrase ``especially in the region of the country where Mormo", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3689, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3686, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 3676, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3553, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3034, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2506, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1938, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1349, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 373, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3721, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 4982099, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 5018939, "2": "`  :This article did appear on the front page for at least 24 hours in April 2004.

Tran Van Ba, according to his own statements, is the person you work for. In fact you have been editing from the same computer as Tran Van Ba. And we have no evidence, other than a large number of computer messages from an E-mail address bearing his name, that Tran Van Ba is who he says he is - and if he is, we have no evidence that what he says is true, except that he says it.  How many times do I have to say this? Tran Van Ba is not an objective source. He is not a book. He is not a newspaper. He is not a historian. He is one of the subjects of the article. He has a conflict of interest. You also have a conflict of interest, since you are (apparently) employed by him and by the family in question.

Your repeated citations of various websites that simply refer to Mr. Nguyen as ``Prince`` are equally irrelevant. They are simply repeating a claim that he has made, which has nothing to do with proving what Bao Dai said or did, or whether there is a Nguyen coat of arms.

You voted for the Wikinews project, so I'm asking for your participation now. Everything is open, nothing is final. What Wikinews will and can be depends in large part on you. There already is a global Wikinews mailing list for discussing the project. If you are interested at all, please subscribe  coordination is of key importance. There's also an IRC channel #wikinews on irc.freenode.net. Realtime discussion can help to polish up articles.   If you're looking for something to do, check out the articles in development and articles in review. Or start a new story in the Wikinews workspace, or ignore the proposed review system - it's up to you. I hope you'll join us soon in this exciting experiment.

I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called ``Race laws`` of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.  :::Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.  :::What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)  :::So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)  :::The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (``they killed Jesus``). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!  :::Now move along to 1297 and ``bingo!`` = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in ``ethnic cleansing`` by wholesale murder and mayhem.  :::Read your history. Move up to the time of 18th Century and read about the status of Jews in Parliament (how and when they were finally allowed to sit in Parliament.)  :::The bottom line. The Magna Carta of 1215 needs to be explained: who wrote it and why and what it says and why. What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say ``me too`` (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3506, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2331, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2934, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2330, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2326, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2329, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2328, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2152, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2324, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2325, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 8565981, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 8571090, "2": "If you think the list of such links on the Christianity article (etc) are biased, then go fight that battle.

Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the ``Israelites`` and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:  * Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article. * Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews. * Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article. * Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article * Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited * Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion. * Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited * Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism * Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links * British-Israel-World Federation  See Anglo-Israelism  I am open to discussion on these, but do read through the article first.

That is very rude.==  The following was deleted by user#24.168.66.27 this morning.  Why would he delete this post, I wonder:  If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.      It wasn't long ago that all references to ``Keith Wigdor`` were removed from this ``surrealism`` article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.     It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this ``surrealism`` article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.  For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1868, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2099, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2490, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 870, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2492, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3865, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3353, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3234, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2892, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3885, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 9341657, "tg": 0.4}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 9349929, "2": "`  ::::There is no reason we cannot talk about both ``intactivism`` and ``intactivists``.

There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.  Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.  Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.  2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.  3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by ``kind ol' Uncle Joe`` babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a ``dictator`` per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.  4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?  5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution: ``http://www.sulinet.hu/eletestudomany/archiv/2000/0042/forr/1319-2..jpg``  Regards: Tamas Feher from Hungary ``etomcat@freemail.hu```", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 751, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 303, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 469, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 175, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1525, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1522, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1515, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1511, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1492, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1459, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 1.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 10082841, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 10102255, "2": "  ==What he knew and when he knew it==  :Though highly critical of the Soviet Union, Chomsky has sometimes been more positive in his assessment of Communist movements in Asia, particularly in the 1960s and '70s when not all information on them was available in the West.

The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance  I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three).

The site is not a ``Wacky Website``, but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!  UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of ``unsigned`` motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.  The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the ``parent`` motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.  As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short ``spur`` motorway actually links two different motorways.  If it is part of the M65, as the ``start of restrictions`` sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state ``M61 (M65)``, meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.    A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the ``start of restrictions`` sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states ``A57(M)``, but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the ``Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995`` that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).  The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a ``C``, ``D`` or ``U`` classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms.`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 840, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 891, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -2.0, "wi": 962, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1872, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2377, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2453, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2457, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2395, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2463, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2462, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 1.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 10574791, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 10607746, "2": "  If you go down to the bottom of the article, in the links is the one to Packing.org, which is described as having a state-by-state database.

Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy: :Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: ``What is your name?`` The princess replied: ``The daughter of Jahan-shah``. Ali said: ``and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called`` (``the bride of the land``).  Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of ``land/country and city`` for ``shahr``?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name.

Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone.

The official title of mixed government is a Republic and the Romans translated ``politiea`` as Republic.  And then to top it off the new article Classical republicanism doesn't refer to the Classical republics of Crete, Sparta, Solonic Athens, or Rome but to Machiavelli's ideology.  How can that be when Venice in the 13th century instituted a mixed government and called herself a ``Republic``.    With Jwrosenwieg and Kim Bruning there was a tacit agreement a year ago to have republic be the modern meaning and a [Classical definition of republic] to describe the ancient republics of Hellas and Rome and their influence.  To say the least the ``Republic section`` is all messed up. We need some clarification.  I have new information but User:Snowspinner won't let me bring this back up for undelete. (I do grant that a little bit of the Classical definition is original but the rest is not.) I will not let Sparta be called anything but a republic!  I will not let the British wikipedian modern republicans strip Sparta, (my heritage and roots) of her rightful name.  She is a Classical republic and needs to be called such!  At the least, where is the damage in having an external link?  I saw your many edits on Athens.  I am sorry to report that she was a Republic under Solon.  Solon was an admirer of the Doric Greeks.  I think you need to rethink your knowledge base and I point you to  and ask you to take a good look at the references to the classical definition at Wikinfo. `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3002, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2408, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 109, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 967, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2218, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2333, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3806, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3576, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3489, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 433, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 11213683, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 11238715, "2": "` ATTN whoever keeps reverting the ``totalitarian`` part: it is a widespread criticism of Castro's regime (and a part of the embargo rationale,) whereas Castro will label anyone opposed to him as ``fascist`` and ``imperialist`` (read the quote on Czechoslovakia.)

First, ``typically`` and ``generally`` are weasel words.  This definition represents RJII's point of view, and violates our neutral poiint of view.  Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.  Fourth, it is just poorly written, the second and third clauses are redundant.  Fifth, it leaves out what many consider the defining feature of capitalism, which is the commoditization of labor.

So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Bet\u0259 Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that ``according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction``). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least. :Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework). :Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant \u2014 Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that ``Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.`` :I've listed my sources below; we'll probably be able to use them in some of the articles. \u2014     :*Bender, M.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.  :If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained.   Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.  :And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable.   Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins.   From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  -   : Considering that ``Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term ``belief`` was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed ``evolutionist bias`` you claim is on the Creationism page.    -  ``Personal bias``?  Nope.

Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it.   You see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that\u2019s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome.   1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing.   2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them \u2018academic\u2019. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it\u2019s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing.   3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement.   4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie\u2019s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.    All this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.

For example, I can use the terms Holy Roman Empire, Thursday, or Queen Elizabeth II without implying that I believe that the empire was holy, or that I worship the Norse god of thunder, or that I recognize the authority of the British monarch.  (Interesting note about the Quakers in the Thursday article though: should we scrub Wikipedia of ``Thursday``?)  Regardless of the historical origins of the abbreviations BC and AD, they now mean little more than indicating the point at which the English-speaking world stops counting years backward and starts counting them forward.  Seriously, how many people read ``BC`` and think that the Messiahship of Jesus is being proclaimed?  Or that AD means they accept Jesus as Lord?  Construing BC and AD as statements of religious devotion may have been valid when the terms were first introduced, but to reject BC and AD now in the face of centuries of tradition and widespread usage seems to be justifiable only under two premises: either (1) that any term with historical origins in religious devotion carries an eternal POV taint and should be excised from Wikipedia, or (2) that the abbreviations still so strongly communicate religious meaning to the majority of users as to make the terminology indeed POV.  The first premise is itself POV (by singling out religion as an unacceptable originator of terminology), and thus should not justify rejecting BC/AD.  The second premise, though is where I think Slrubenstein and others are coming from (do correct me if I'm wrong).  If this premise can be validated, then the POV-ness of BC/AD is established, and use of these abbreviations should be abandoned throughout Wikipedia in favor of BCE/CE.  On the other hand, if BC/AD is shown not to convey religious meaning to the majority of Wikipedia users, then it should be the favored usage in most articles based on its familiarity to readers.  Perhaps another poll could be taken to address the simple yes/no question: Does modern usage of BC/AD convey a religious point of view to you?  Assuming a sufficiently representative response by Wikipedians, the results may be a better indication of how to resolve this controversy than simply asking for people's preferences between BC/AD and BCE/CE.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2169, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2549, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3150, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2597, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1278, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3155, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3163, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1070, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3077, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2967, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.8, "wi": -1, "ri": 13570767, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 13583543, "2": " : As a suggestion, before I implement it, if that is indeed what you have in mind, that you discuss it with some other Wikipedians.", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1222, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1376, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1700, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3379, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2898, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2900, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3273, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4011, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3436, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2752, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 13583543, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 13594645, "2": "  ==User: Yuber== Hello, KaintheScion.

I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own. The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements, space-time is everything, and something exists outside of space-time, are true. However, I work in computer software and don't do physics (although this is really about philosophy), so maybe I'm just using the the wrong kind of logic?    ::If time is finite, then there must be a beginning (which is what I think is meant by ``at some point``).

I wasn't really comfortable with the version that came before it, though.  First cause is a complex topic, or at least a lot has been said about it, and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy.  If someone could write a good article about the first cause debate, and maybe link to it from this article, that would be good.  I'm not really qualified to do it.  Also, and I haven't made an edit about this, I'm uncomfortable, as a physicist, with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism.

's proposal:  I agree that the above list of statements on this issue does not constitute a vote, and I don't think Jtdrl claimed that it was a vote. Therefore we need to have a proper vote, decide on a position, and then enforce it. I therefore propose a vote (to be announced at the Australian Wikipedians Notice Board and conducted here). The vote should be between two policy positions, one written by Skyring and anyone who agrees with him, and the other written by those who disagree with him.  My proposed policy position is this: *That in Government of Australia, and in all other articles dealing with Australia's system of government, it should be stated that: :1. Australia is a constitutional monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy :2. Australia's head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia :3. Under the Constitution, almost all of the Queen's functions are delegated to and exercised by the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative. *That any edit which states that (a) Australia is a republic, (b) the Governor-General is Australia's head of state, or (c) Australia has more than one head of state, will be reverted, and that such reversions should not be subject to the three-reversions rule. *Edits which say that named and relevant persons (eg politicians, constitutional lawyers, judges) disagree with the above position, and which quote those persons at reasonable length, are acceptable, provided proper citation is provided and the three factual statements are not removed.

Well, based on the wikipedia info a US ``partial zero emissions vehicle`` could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.  Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.  Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.  It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad ``20mpg`` reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations.

Also, if you look at the U.S. Constitution, both the Preamble and Article II repeatedly and consistently refer to ``the United States of America.``  From the surrounding wording, it is clear that the Founders were referring to a single legal entity and believed they were constituting such an entity.  So ``the United States of America`` is the legal name of the federal government.  There are also many sections in the United States Code which refer to ``the United States of America.``     * They are referred to in both the Constitution and other documents as ``the United States`` because before 1787, they were semi-independent.  This is where the Americans clouded the definitions of state and nation that the rest of the world successfully differentiates.  The Constitution was the coming together of states that minted their own currency, engaged in trade wars with each other, refused to extradite criminals just because they happened to cross a state line, etc. into a ``Union`` hence how they became the ``United.``  Up until the Civil War (especially in the South) is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didn't agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into.  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s, etc.  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it.   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine.  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics (and some Kingdoms).  If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the ``Articles of Confederation`` from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).  Your conceptualization of inter-state relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited.  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine. \u2014   I hold a bachelor's degree in history from the most prestigious public university in the United States.  I am well-aware of all of the facts you just mentioned, especially the delicate fragility of the Union throughout its first century.  I am also familiar with all the diverse what-if scenarios.    I do not have all day to write on talk pages.  I did not think it was necessary to rehash the convoluted details of two centuries of American history just to explain how we got to our present pigpen of legal fictions and political realities.  But thanks for doing that for me.    When I said ``wording`` above, I was referring to the consistent use of the definite article, ``the,`` rather than the plural demonstrative adjective, ``these,`` in the Constitution.  But you did clarify something I neglected, the task of explaining why the Constitution has to refer to states which are united, as opposed to, say, ``the United State.``     == Vandalism protection ==  I know the vandalism is now infrequent, but is it necessary?  I don't think so since so many people watch this page anyway...     == Republicans and religious Jews ==  Excuse me.  In the ``Politics`` section, the following sentence appears:  :The Republicans generally receive more funding and support from business groups, religious Christians and Jews, and rural Americans, while the Democratic party receives more support from labor unions and minority ethnic groups.  In the history,  sliced out the phrase ``and Jews`` and then  promptly reverted it.  Now, I'm a little confused.  Historically, when Jews are considered as a voting bloc, they tend to lean Democratic.  However, this analysis has always considered Jews as a single ethnic class and not separated out religious Jews from non-religious Jews.  Therefore, my question:  Does anyone have evidence that religious Jews tend to vote Republican (or Democratic)?  \u2014  21:28, 2004 Dec 30 (UTC)  == Social Issues ==  I added some more information about the incarceration/prison situation in the US.

And we have another doctor who said Terri was cortically blind. We can report those two facts as is. But no one has come out and judged that the autopsy report is right and Cheshire is wrong, so we cannot report that. Since Cheshire and Thogmartin are both doctors, we can't dismiss one out of hand over the other. They both qualify as ``expert testimony``. If some plumber testified in court that Terri was watching him, then I think we could argue that we could take that out as incorrect information and rely on Thogmartin alone. But this is doctor-versus-doctor, and all we can do is report who said what. As it is now, Cheshire says Terri watched him, and then parenthesis point out the autopsy two weeks later says something different. So, the conflicting facts are present next to each other. That's all we can do and remain npov.    ::Since I heaped praise upon ' for his balanced and non-extremist POV, it is only fair that I give ' credit for not pushing his POV, even though he doesn't appear to me to always abide by this high standard.

I believe the medical literature has reported cases in which the brain looked fairly normal but the person was PVS.

Thank you (in advance) for your assistance.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2871, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2626, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2679, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2680, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2681, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3931, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4082, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4095, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -2.0, "wi": 3813, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 829, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 15619232, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 15642141, "2": "  ==Waves of the City ethnic tailfin== Thanks for letting me know that only two registrations apply to this fin and for updating the Image Description Page.

There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.   *****Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., ``only`` yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  ``Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions.`` (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.    Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?    *See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. -   *To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as ``partisan bickering`` and ``bullshit``. -   **Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. ``All other parties,`` according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a ``consensus`` behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: ``Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.``   ***Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. -    I wasn't  ``brought in`` to vote. Nor was I voting ``ideologically``, rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments    :Who am I attacking?  And saying I ``should present more compelling arguments`` supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. -    I wasn't  ``brought in`` to vote, I wasn't voting ``ideologically`` and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.    Regardless of who the poll may have ``brought in``, I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to ``bring in`` opinions from members of the community.

How are the barrels rotated?  A.  The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B).  The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly.  This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.  Q.  How long is typical spin-up time?  A.  While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous.   On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be ``water washed`` (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 691, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 182, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2880, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2185, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2874, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2372, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 151, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1354, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1202, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1463, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 16948063, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 17025120, "2": "  == Confucianism ==  Confucius predates Aristotle in using family as a model for the state.  He believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation.  The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government.

I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.  Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.  Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title ``Queen of Australia``, for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title ``Queen of Australia`` was introduced.    :Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - ``I did this to make a point!``. A point about ``literal`` text is make by using the adjective ``literal``. Your point belongs elsewhere.  :Anyway, the literal text does not mention ``Queen Victoria`` it mentions the ``Queen``. It further states that the ``Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time``. This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but ``Queen Victoria``! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!  ::Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.    ::I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.    :::Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au  ::::``Not found The page you requested is not available at this address.`` I suggest you check the original. I have.    :Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say ``Please!``, ``Read the constitution``, you are showing contempt for others.     ::When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.    If you refer to the ``literal text`` of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a ``Queen of Australia,`` and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.    I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in ``Queen Victoria`` !!! So I reduced it to just just ``Queen`` (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.    :Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.    I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.    Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement ``the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen``. Nowhere. s2 states ``A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative``. That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: ``There shall be an Inter-State Commission``. There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example", "6": [{"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1720, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2390, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1798, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1090, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1346, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 2179, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2375, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2387, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1294, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2398, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 1.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 17202143, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 17236986, "2": "  ::Personally I'd have nothing there (i.e. no space or comma) but the MoS trumps me, I guess.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku, Demographics of Azerbaijan, .az History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Ottoman Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans, List of Azerbaijanis, and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).  He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including , , (user page and talkpages), ,   (talkpages), , , .  Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).  Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent.   The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..).   This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious.   As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to , , , , , the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

I really don't think there is any question that this and the silly thing about it being coined should be removed.   6 July 2005 17:19 (UTC)`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3411, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4019, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3033, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2521, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3951, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2067, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2072, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": -2.0, "wi": 3800, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3436, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 469, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 18269644, "tg": 0.3}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18274620, "2": "  6 July 2005 18:47 (UTC)", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2498, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2539, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1783, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1713, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2501, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2596, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2550, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 814, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2402, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2579, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 18274620, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 18280118, "2": "  6 July 2005 20:18 (UTC)", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3782, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4134, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1246, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2348, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 825, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3518, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3276, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2548, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4100, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 831, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 18280118, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18289146, "2": "`  ==Query== Does anyone know what this means, and who the unnamed academics are? ``However, some academics from the fields of sociology and anthropology, while supporting Churchill's politics in general, are concerned about the quality of scholarship shown in his work and the casual way in which ethnic studies departments handle issues of academic integrity.``   July 6, 2005 22:41 (UTC)`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1799, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1642, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 253, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 2836, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2833, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2832, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2888, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3754, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3685, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2295, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 18289146, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 18294727, "2": "  == You were right about the personal attack ==  so i removed it.

I would like to move some of the stuff on the Endurance and the Expedition out of the Shackleton article, since their scope is really quite a bit larger than him - can I do this? Is there any special way? ``  A: Absolutely yes!  It's pretty easy....just pick a concise and appropriate name for a new article on the expedition and start to build new content there.  You get started by putting the new article title in the search box.  If it's available you'll get offered a link to start a new article with that name.  I suggest putting some comments on the discussion page of your new article describing what you are trying to accomplish (same thing goes for the Shackleton article).  That way, other editors won't misunderstand what's going on.   If the new article is going to be under construction for awhile, it's a good idea to put a ``stub`` notice at the bottom of it so folks know that there is more to come.  You add a stub notice by putting this at the bottom of the page: {{stub}}  As the new article takes shape and adds breadth and depth that the parent article lacks, you may find you need to tinker with the parent article to ensure that there is the right amount of detail there...not too much and not too little.    Lastly, you'll want to find out what other articles exist that should link to your new article and add links on them.  That requires a bit of searching and digging around but usually isn't a problem and helps integrate your article into the broader encyclopedia.  Good luck with your article!

They're sort of understandable from a new user like Mr. Harvey, who seems unfamiliar with Wikipedia policy and principles, but I find them incomprehensible from a seasoned editor like Sam Spade. It seems to me self-evident that if Mr. Harvey controls the copyright, then we can't use the image other than under the conditions he dictates. And since those conditions include having an embedded, uneditable, caption, in violation of the wiki principle, that means we can't and won't use it at all. (That's  apart from the phrasing of the caption being IMO quite unacceptable\u2014it's enough that it's uneditable.) Mr Harvey, it's just not the case that your regiment, or the Queen for that matter, is in charge of Wikipedia style. You seem to assume that all that's needed for your caption to carry absolute authority is that a spokesman for the regiment should ``clarify`` the form of address / title, that ``should`` be used, and then it will, it must, be used. You are wrong about that: forms of address and titles used here are matters for Wikipedia consensus and policy. Your employers are not empowered to dictate to the world how to speak. I can understand that you think they are, but I don't understand Sam at all. Sam, how can you see Mr. Harvey's demand to dictate the caption as part of an ``interpersonal conflict``? It's a conflict of principle. You write: I have recieved an email stating that Richard Harvey is the Photo Archivist at the Duke of Wellington's Regimental HQ, and that a condition of their usage is that the the name, rank & title be embedded. That is good enough for me, I see no reason to doubt that this is the case, or to refuse to utilise the images under these conditions.. Those two conclusions are miles apart. No, there is no reason to doubt it. Yes, there is every reason to refuse to utilise the image under such conditions. It's a pity Mr. Harvey has had second thoughts about the image he uploaded the first time, the one without a caption, and it's, well, just... odd, that he sees cropping off the caption as defamation, but we'll have to live with that.  |  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1378, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 0, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 208, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 487, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1087, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1135, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2185, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2880, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1678, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2886, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 18494032, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 18509272, "2": "  It's a also the name of a famous freelance hooker bar in Bangkok, Thailand.", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1533, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1739, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1757, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1787, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1798, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1637, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 653, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 42, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 607, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 972, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 18509272, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18517178, "2": " == Hey, I am Ari ==  Ok...About me in terms of my contribution on Wikipedia.

That is why I support the idea of including ``Jewish`` at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to ``single out`` Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' ``early anouncements``,  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his ``extraordinarily reliable Agent D`` report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary ``contributors`` to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an ``interest`` on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3808, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1082, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3640, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1405, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2129, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2263, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2862, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2911, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3401, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1254, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 18692184, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18695134, "2": "`   um... ghetto speak stays in the ghetto. educated people pronounce the ``r``.`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2300, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2110, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1814, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1267, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1068, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 853, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2342, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2362, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2374, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2317, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 18695134, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18696130, "2": " (UTC) grow up, common usage is allowed.  20:42, 12 July 2005", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 380, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2541, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2286, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2141, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 897, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 710, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 381, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2564, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3715, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3786, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 18696130, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18697596, "2": "   ===Blocked===  Last time I tried to leave a message asking for an update on my entry in your encyclopedia I received a page that said I had been blocked because I was not responsive to the trolls who keep asking the same useless questions over and over on the Discussion Archive of Ashida Kim.

Our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though, so I thought I'd continue under a new heading. Hope you have no objection. I'm still under the gun with that project I mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! Wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...I'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to. 1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and ``your editorial colleagues``, yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same ``additional facilities`` (which I take to mean ``tools``) as you, so I don't have the same control. Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination. 2. Also regarding ``tools`` I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements. There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the ``teaser`` entry for Crapsey. Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: ``we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!`` 3. Regarding your statement that it's ``actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,`` are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the ``offending contributor`` simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be. Have no idea what you mean by ``the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page.`` Can you point me to a sample of this? 4. Regarding your statement that ``he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague? Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as ``malicious`` turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-)  5. On your reply to 3 above that ``Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' `` I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL ``license,`` which, from my understanding of the law, means ``with permission.`` The author still ``owns`` the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP. 6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you ``don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,`` this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other ``watchers`` like you (still don't know what your title is) know ``what's new`` on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another? Again, thanks. Will try and get back later or tomorrow.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1556, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2181, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1106, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2164, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2146, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1186, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 359, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2011, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1968, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 317, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 18923425, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 18931865, "2": "` ``Banned Group Leads Dissent in Egypt`` By Daniel Williams.

By the same reasoning anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue, which is what should be included in the  Critical of the Group section. This has been discussed at length above.

Red Alert!! I know I was a tad slow in responding, but didn't you see my 500-word essey here: Talk:Terri_Schiavo/Mediation#Archive_.2F_reboot? The exact link is here: Talk:Terri_Schiavo/Mediation/summaries, and, as if we didn't let loose enough, there, didn't you see the new section I created here Talk:Terri_Schiavo/Mediation#Other_Key_Points:_YOUR_VOTE_IS_NEEDED_HERE??   :::::Let me add that your ability to find POV errors, SlimVirgin, is not unlike NCdave's excellent skill. For example, when I first was asked how I thought of the page in the peer review or whatever they call it, I said it was OK. However, after I got to looking at NCdave's criticisms, and looked closer at the language and accuracy, I not only found 500-words, but like Dave, had to go above-and-beyond with additional comments. People like you and Dave (and Ruch Limbaugh) are my heroes for finding errors that are otherwise unnoticeable (and Wagon's not bad at this either, though his findings seem typically to sway more to the center or liberal left, in my opinion). Therefore, it is of high surprise that you couldn't find ``key issues,`` either yourself, or those we've identified. (A folder of 500-word essays awaits you.) Likewise, when Uncle Ed was my own role model and example on how to solve a dispute, a method I successfully copied to be the ``great negotiator`` and put out ``World War III`` at the en.WikiQuotes.org ``Abortion`` quotations weg page, it was likewise a surprise that Uncle Ed fancied himself the failure at negotiations, that had somewhat stalled: Talk:Terri_Schiavo/Mediation#Well.3F, ``It has been 4 days since the last contribution to this Mediation. Is everyone giving up, or what? I didn't feel particularly good about putting a user block on FuelWagon, but does that change anything?`` Uncle Ed's only problems are having to deal with UNscreened employees (editor/writers), who are NOT paid employees (quality is ``you get what you pay for``) and, none of us (far as I know) are paid. CONCLUSION: You all are my role models, and brighter than you may appear, so scratch for answers -and have a good time off, while Uncle Ed takes a wiki vacation -probably to work at a ``real, paying`` job or rest up.   `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3969, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3759, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 68, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4029, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1599, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 744, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3174, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3506, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 4032, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 826, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 1.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 19195680, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 19197390, "2": "  == Uh... ==  ... why did you speedy delete Wikipedia:GNAA votes for deletion policy?

The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief. Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran. There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD!   Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.  Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

At any rate, you probably just didn't see my objection; I'll do more to address it myself, but the style isn't up to par for our (rightly) high standards for featured articles.     ==", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 628, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1852, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2244, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3558, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2496, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2552, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3564, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2799, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 478, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3561, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 19860636, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 19876561, "2": "` :::When I say ``insecurity``, I mean as a result of the PRC's continued emphasis on ``liberating Taiwan`` and coupling the issue with the national psyche to the point where no one in Beijing today could afford to be seen as having ``lost Taiwan`` (the fact that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC not withstanding). Remember that Taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the CCP and the KMT before World War II, with Mao even being quoted in the 30's as supporting Taiwan independence from Japan. Why Taiwan and not Mongolia? Well politics basically... the PRC's need to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union at the time and to drum up support against ``western imperialism`` and CKS's Taipei regime. CKS of course also recognized Mongolia in the 20's or 30's to try to woo Soviet support, but ``revoked it`` (ha ha) after 1949 as there was no need to try to placate the Soviets anymore.

In general, contemporary interpretations of the ``IQ gap`` can be divided into three broad categories:  # ``culture-only`` or ``environment-only`` interpretations that posit only non-genetic causes (e.g., socioeconomic inequality or minority culture membership) that differentially affect racial groups; and # ``partly genetic`` interpretations that posit an IQ gap between racial groups caused by approximately the same matrix of genetic and environmental forces that cause IQ differences among individuals of the same race. # ``insufficient data``: no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence.

Now - on with the explanation. The Coriolis effect is a change-of-coordinates force (and thus bears intriguing similarities with gravity, whether this means anything or not is unclear). When you move from one coordinate system to one that is rotating with respect to the first, then the equations of motion for a particle acquire an extra term: the coriolis term (and one other of second order in omega but we'll neglect that). So: if you wish to formulate the equations of motion for air on the surface of the earth, it is natural do to it in a coordinate system stationary wrt the earths surface: in that case, you end up with a coriolis force. You could, if you wished, write the equations in a system non-rotating wrt the fixed stars (perhaps ignoring the rotation of the earth round the sun). In this system, there would be no coriolis effect and hence no coriolis force. However there would be a very rapidly moving lower boundary to account for and this would be deeply inconvenient. since the coriolis term is easy to incorporate, there is no particular reason to do this. But... this is only the coordinate system in which you choose to write your equations. It has no effect on the physics, and cyclones continue to rotate no matter which system you describe them in.  The coriolis effect is *not physics*: it is kinematics.  19:51:33, 2005-07-31 (UTC). [end of copied section]   William M Connolley is simultaneously saying that the coriolis effect is physics, and that it isn't.   An article about the coriolis effect should explain the following:. If (hypotherically speaking) a low pressure area would form on a non-rotating planet, then the air would flow towards the low pressure area and the pressure gradient would very rapidly be leveled.  But that is not what is happening on Earth. On Earth, air starts flowing around a low pressure area, amazingly, it tends strongly to flow perpendigular to the pressure gradient, and it can take weeks for a low pressure area to become leveled again  So there must be a physical mechanism that performs a restructuring of the direction of wind flow.    A general coordinate transform transforms the entire picture in one go, if you employ a coordinate transformaton to a rotating coordinate system on, say, a large grid, then the grid will turns around as a whole, with the whole picture remaining in a fixed form.   That is not what happens in the atmosphere! If you let go lots of weather balloons in the area of a low pressure area forming, then over time the positions of the balloons in the circling winds will be thoroughly mixed. The more central parts of the system rotate faster.  William says that the coriolis effect is to be understood as purely a cosmetic change: a coordinate transformation, that does not alter the physics taking place.   But Willam also believes the following: from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley/Coriolis_effect :The Coriolis force plays a strong role in weather patterns, where it affects prevailing winds and the rotation of storms, as well as in the direction of ocean currents. Above the atmospheric boundary layer, friction plays a relatively minor role, as air parcels move mostly parallel to each other. Here, an approximate balance between pressure gradient force and Coriolis force exists, causing the geostrophic wind, which is the wind effected by these two forces only, to blow along isobars (along lines of constant geopotential height, to be precise). Thus a northern hemispheric low pressure system rotates in a counterclockwise direction, while northern hemispheric high pressure systems or cyclones on the southern hemisphere rotate in a clockwise manner, as described by Buys-Ballot's law.   This is why I recognize that there are two contexts, that both called 'coriolis effect'.  One context is about physical mechanisms, the other is about coordinate transformation.   |  ", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3585, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3603, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3598, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3539, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3476, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3295, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1318, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1389, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2326, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2800, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 20002771, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 20010220, "2": " Indeed, I started Glossary of Japanese history; this can be helpful in those unfamiliar with tons of terms in Japanese history.", "6": [{"ts": 2.0, "wi": 3561, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1861, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1856, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3522, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1387, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3509, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2801, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3562, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3564, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 246, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 20010220, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 20012511, "2": "` *How is ``I am lying now`` both true and false???

Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with ``approve & oppose``. The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write ``weak approve`` or ``strong approve`` when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using ``violence``. Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at.

They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. -   == For willmcw ==  I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!  :Why do you delete the number of ``Carson`` appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article.

That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.   ==Greetings==  Greetings and welcome to wikipedia.

There's nothing inherently pejorative about the term.  ``Redskin`` and ``Pale Face`` even enjoy a certain amount use as terms of affection between the two races.  I imagine that there are some Native Americans who dislike the term (just as some, maybe even more understandably, hate the word ``Indian``), just as there are some who find the terms white, black, and yellow offensive.  (Though ``yellow`` is probably a special case, since it is sometimes associated with cowardice, there are still some contexts in which few if any people would be offended by it, such as in ``all people, whether White, Black, Red, or Yellow, should be treated equally``, in which the usage is very explicitly non-derogatory.)  :Although, this may depend on the area or the individuals involved.  For example, a Native American would probably not be offended by being called a  ``Redskin`` by a White friend who he knows to be anything but a racist, but might strongly object to being called a ``Redskin`` by a member of the KKK.  Likewise, in areas where Native Americans are the largest racial ``minority``, there has probably already been a long history of mutual cooperation and friendship between the Whites and ``Redskins`` of the area (and many Whites who very proudly boast a Native herritage), who would not immediately think any word was intended pejoratively unless given good reason to do so.  I know in my area, where racism against Mexicans and Asians is somewhat common (and sadly, even expected), the idea of racism against Natives is strange and alien, since the Whites and the Redskins here have such a long history together and such a strong respect for one another.  Although that might also have to do with the fact that most of the cities in my area were founded by Scottish and Irish immigrants who were treated as outcasts in the rest of the U.S., so the Whites who settled here in the early years knew first-hand how hurtful prejudices and stereotypes could be.  :In any event, it's not really accurate (and more than a little ignorant) to say that the word ``Redskin`` is a pejorative, when it is clearly not an offensive word in all contexts, and may even be, as mentioned above, a term of as a term of affection.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4124, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 4123, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3948, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3655, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3514, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3513, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1249, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1209, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 831, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4144, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 21102072, "tg": 0.3}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 21119629, "2": "`  I have been thinking about this for a while.

This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others. It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-H\u00e9gelianism. YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov. You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of ``mass communication`` and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.   I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.   I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or r\u00e9v\u00e9lation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years. Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.   No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.   Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met? They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.  Here are some other links who do compleete the picture: The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer: http://aeamh.free.fr/x/agent.html http://aeamh.free.fr/blockhaus/ http://aeamh.free/bk/index.html  YBM Web site:  http://aeamh.free.fr Site Voyer: http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/  I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology. I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.

I don't know, what I do know is that he wrote some very racist things on his website, and made fun of the black children whose faces he painted, calling them niggers- I realize that is just a word, but it is a word that evokes much hatred and racial division. On his website he writes very negatively about Jewish people. With a vim and vigor that would lead one to beleive he does not like people of the jewish faith. His poem Jimi Hendrix was a field hand has some very strong language that is derrogatory to Jimi Hendrix and other Africna Americans. I can't make this up.

Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a ``special-operations-type`` organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine. I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.

You just try to found reasons to shut me up and abuse your status as admi to do so but ain't not better than YBM. You are doing exactly the same as him. Why do you remove my answer TO YOUR ARTICLE from the main frame and let the answer made by YBM and others for exemple? This is clearly discrimination. My answer is all too relevant to the affair discussed as are all my article as the last ones have to do with the crdibility of the people who have been the upmost against the Bogdanovs and have critisize their theory the most. I do not think that a DEA in informatic make a person capable to critisize the work of professionals in theorethic Physic. To do so you will have to be Stephen W Hawking and the alike. I have pointed how discusting the methods of YBM were and was able to come with tangibles prooves of it. Thats why he hurried to deleet them. But you came, afet 6 days he had done that and 6 days I tried to put it back, and...banished me!!! then after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column. But it isn't at all what happened. My answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users. They have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside. You don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case. As for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for. i do not think that an aristrocats fan is welcome in a place like wiki who require essentially people having a great sens of honnor, democratie, equality, common sens, and who value ethic. That rules you out, as action speak louder than any words could ever do.  I do not salute you.

Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called ``a controversial person`` and was much different than its current incarnation.  The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.  The references to ``Oh Paula`` probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.  I'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are - Coulter wanting to ``bring down the president``, no matter the best interests of her client/advisee  - Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed - Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her ``trailer trash``)  Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.  Though it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the ``trailer-park trash`` comment.   It is not satire or sarcasm to achieve comic effect, it is an honest to goodness insult.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 292, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 59, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 643, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 400, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 607, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 599, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 517, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 656, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 465, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 653, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 22455813, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 22489715, "2": "` :Some of the recent edits to the history section are dubious. ``Red China`` and ``Communist terrorists`` etc -  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3616, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3877, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3465, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2638, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2637, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2559, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2483, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1225, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 539, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 792, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 22489715, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 22502783, "2": "  ==Wikimania 2006== In the course of informal discussions at Wikimania in Frankfurt the possibility of having Wikimania 2006 in Vancouver was raised.  What makes Canada desirable for such a meeting is the capacity to draw delegates from the United States.  For many overseas delegates, however, U.S. visa requirements make that country less attractive.  All else being equal, Europeans see Vancouver as a more interesting Canadian city to visit than Toronto, the only other Canadian city to receive significant consideration.  Preliminary bids from various cities need to be made by Sept. 30, 2005.  A short list will be drawn from those bids.  Is there enough interest and energy to put together such a conference in Vancouver for August 2006?  The people in Frankfurt put on a tremendous gathering, with a core organizational group of about a dozen people.  Some 400 people attended from 52 different countries.  I expect that a North American Wikimania could be a little smaller, but we would still need a suitable facility.  It would be good to know that such a facility is available for a conference; the type of youth hostel facility that was used in Frankfurt does not exist in North America.  What would be the cost of hosting such a conference at UBC?  I'm looking for interest and commitment.  To that end I am proposing a Vancouver meetup for Saturday, Sept. 24.  If someone has a reasonably accesible place for such a meeting please let me know.  (I live in Richmond, but something in the city of Vancouver would be more appropriate.)

So what makes you think that using religion as the primary criterion of nationality is not the closest thing to the truth? Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but neither you nor me are in position to decide that. This is why in my version all criteria used in the demographies are explained in detail, without deciding which is right and which is wrong, and that my friend is what we call neutrality. You might as well try and take a hint. Nothing from the Turkish cencus proves nor implies that those Greeks were not Greek speaking. The majority of Bulgarian population had never been adherent to the Patriarch of Constantinople. You're confusing yourself with the small Bulgarian or Slavic-speaking population which viewed itself as part of the Roman nation which had lost its mother tongue over time. Therefore despite religion and language, the greater part of the population of Southern Macedonia viewed itself as Greek (or Roman if you prefer). Then if we can't trust any demography, think of the population exchanges. 50,000 Greeks entered Greek Macedonia from Pirin Macedonia, and some 60,000 Bulgarians left for Bulgaria. Then some 500,000 Greeks enter from Turkey and suddenly, we have some 1 million Greeks in Greek Macedonia? Where did the other half million come from? Mars? Oh, I know, it's a Bulgarian ``majority`` group that the Greek government is still hiding isn't that so? And now think of the ludicrous numbers that you're trying to pass as the truth: 2 million Bulgars in the entire of Macedonia and the assumption of another million in the south. I mean, use your brain for ones and do the maths - have you ever checked what the population of Bulgaria is today? Honestly some people just can't take the truth. And if neither of that convinces you then think of the Greco-Serbian alliance. Would the Serbs have ever agreed with Greece occupying over half of Macedonia for itself unless that land was not primarily Greek? Serbia was significantly stronger than Greece and in the search of Slavic-speaking lands to assimilate. It would have never happened. If you really want to do something to help your country, I would advise you to go over there and offer your people some physical help. I don't think that making nationalist propaganda of the internet is one of their priorities at the moment.    `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2822, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1552, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 0, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 2881, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2904, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1172, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 409, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2824, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 164, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2431, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.8, "wi": -1, "ri": 23102940, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 23142982, "2": "  Consider yourself reported.

Japanese (actually Okinawan) masters of the 19th and early 20th century have changed the art into a new, modern fighting art, just as languages change, like Bihal writes: French is a French language.

There's no doubt about that, so why doubt the fact that (the modern) karate is Japanese?     `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1255, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1128, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 781, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 351, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 163, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1473, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1441, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1472, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 158, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1379, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 23244814, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 23249681, "2": "  == Reverting - Cold War People ==  Pearle, I hope you don't mind my reverting your last edit.

Gabriel. So, Mark A. Gabriel is the new real name for this man.  This is from the introduction page of ``Islam and Terrorism``;  The NAME YOU see on the cover of this book is not the Muslim name that was given to me by my parents in Egypt. However, I would like to say that I have no desire to deceive Muslims, Christians or anyone else about my name in order to benefit my self. Rather, I have chosen my name for the following reasons.  Reason #1 After I left Egypt, I went to South Africa and was discipled in Christ there. When I began ministering to Muslims in South Africa, I became very well known by my Muslim name. For four years radical Muslims pursued me diligently. I had to hide all the time and change my residency from one city to another almost on a monthly basis. When I wrote my first book in South Africa, my pastor and I discussed whether I should put my name on it. We decided to change my name for security reasons.  Reason #2 I was not comfortable living my Christianity by a Muslim name. I felt my Muslim name was part of my old man. When a person called me by that  name, it reminded me of my old life. I want to live by a Christian name.  Choice of name I chose the first name of Mark because Mark was a writer of the Gospels. Mark was also the first Christian who went to Egypt with the Good News. When Jesus sent the seventy out from Jerusalem, Mark brought the gospel to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. I chose the last name of Gabriel because Gabriel was the angel who brought the good news of the coming of the Messiah to the virgin Mary. Also this was the name of the first Christian person I met in South Africa who took me into his home and invited me to his church.

My sister was locked up against her will in a similar institution here in Sweden (but run by the municipality) when she got her first child without being married. And the bureaucrats tried to take her child. In that institution there were a number of women locked up that just had given birth. Their only ``crime`` being that they got a child without being married, the father of the child ``being absent`` and not protecting the woman and the woman not having a family that could protect her.   When my family finally found out where my sister was we managed to liberate her. (The bureaucrats clearly had not realised that my sister had a big family that could protect her.) After that the bureaucrats attacked us by all legal (and illegal) means at their disposal. We had to keep my sister hidden from the authorities for several months while we informed the politicians and gathered evidence to defend ourselves against the bureaucrats. Finally with the help of some politicians the bureaucrats were made to stop their efforts to take my sisters child and locking her up again. Afterwards our lawyer said that as far as she knew we were the first family ever in Sweden to manage to keep a child in spite the bureaucrats being on full attack. And this happened as recently as 1999-2000.  Why the bureaucrats do these things I don't know. Perhaps there is black money to get in the adoption business or they simply do it so they ``have something to do`` so their department won't get downsized. The scary thing is that this is an ongoing thing, defenceless women (but good mothers) are still being locked up and get their babies taken like that in Sweden.

For example, in frequentist stats you can't attach a probability to a hypothesis, so you can't talk about the probability of the hypothesis given the data. Instead, you have to mess around with the probability of the data given the hypothesis, which is not really what you want. Bayesian hypothesis testing is thus very simple in principle (though the sums may get hard in practice). You attach a prior probability to the hypothesis, multiply by the likelihood and divide by the probability of he evidence to normalise it.

(I am not saying that Bayesian stats generally has a problem with zero and one as probabilities, just when they are used as priors.)

Why would Palpatine propagate his deformation by continuing to generate Force lightning? Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely ``warped`` all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, ``He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important.`` When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, ``SUCKER!`` to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better. Alright so Mace was duped, but Samuel was obviously pacified. Di Mace still make an impact? In a way, he did.

For your knowledge Meru was officilly placed here to watch this talk page by mediator Nicholas Turnbull, and this talking is in the process on entering the arbitation comity, so your interventions here are so outplaced as they can be! I talked with Nicholas Turnbull tonight who disagree with your actions. You are not appointed here and do not have to make decisions above the heads of the members of the arbitration comity, so you will be very kind to step aside and anihilate your previous doing. This is not your playground. I do not know what are your motives to acting as you do as nobody has ever seen you here, but you do seems to go at it with a revenge. Any reasons who would be worth mentioning now? You have just been elected admi and the first thing you do is blocking and banning fox from a site you don't know and that you were not aware of for 24 hours ago. This don't go, you are overstepping wikis rules and previously made decision about this talkpage. You are acting very unbalanced and provocating a chaos who wasn't there before and who in fact wasn't there as far as the 22th of september. Isn't your role to make things work?  Another veru very important thing is that you are walking on my article about a Settlement Proposal, that I do recommend you to read carefully, and that you don't have answer to in your recents edits above, and who therefor have no place what so ever under my article and as a part of it. So moove your articles above, to follow suite of your childrens fights, and leave the growing up doing the right thing. This article above was the one I was writng and in fact inserted in Meru own talk page before you made your intrance here, and before the situation degenerated that much. I did it in an attempt to calm tempers down and create a new tangible goal with better opportunity to solve this dilema than revert war and banishments war. I was stopped at inserting my article by constant editing of article from people fighting, and had each time to perform some changement of my article before saving it, at the end it was too late, you hade arrived, talk like c\u00e9sar, ban a person wihtout valuable and argued explainations, without warning, and taken over the role assignated to Meru by N. Turnbull a few days ago.  By the time I arrived to save my article about burrying the hachet, heads had already rolled, thanks for you. For your knowledge, you did it at midnight, a saturday evening, and this kind of action will have required the presence of more users, and an agreement between those. Your opinion about the presence of Igor or not on his talkpage is none of your business, but the business of the arbitration comity and their decision, not yours. You will have to be more patient and leave to other the right to decide. Know your chain of command, and the wikis appointed chain of event before a ban can take place, specialy a definitiv ban! What about the other guy who begin this reverting phase all together? isn't he guilty as well or is he your personnal friend in the discussion forum? For if this is the case, and if you do have preferences for who is right and who is wrong, so you shouldn't be here and make interventions as well. You have to stay neutral, but your judgement sounds arbitrary to me, to the point that even your collegue Meru didn't understood what and why you were doing this and disagreed. Why are you making troubles, and tell me why the alone person who support your actions, is rjb, the exact person known for insulting peoples very often, reverting all the time, and having started this reverting war completely iognoring previous concensus made about the contain of the biography on this talk page. He was destroying the work of people, to who it had taken several weeks to obtain. You didn't baned him, why? Is he your socket puppet, or are you his? What were you doing 6 hours ago and why did you came here? Did someone warned you? What triggered your hush at coming by, first time, so late? I would very much like to know.  You will please move your dispute and different blowings up on one another on a different place, and will take your bad saturday night mood swing somewhere else than on this talkpage, unless you have a satisfactory explaination for what just did happened. You can't ban Igor when Holger Beck Nielsen is going to make an intervention on this talk page. I hope you know who this person is. i do notice that the 2 persons who made reverting a war, and insisted on it are ybm and rjb who are both in very close contact with each other, and in fact I am quiet sure that rjb is The socket puppet of YBM.

However, if their parents are still members, their names are kept in MIS (not as members, but part of a family who has a member) with the parents until they are 18. Non-Baptized spouses are also included. If I remember the designations for these are ``Child of Record,`` (0-8) ``Unbaptized`` (9-18) and ``Non-Member`` (18+). They used to have an ``unaccountable`` designation as well for those with disabilities who don't need to be baptized, although I've not seen it recently (no ``unaccountables`` in my last ward that I'm aware of), and they'd also be included with ``Child of record`` in my opinion. Church statistics are more accurate than most other denomination's ``estimates`` and the computer system designates and distinguishes quite easily. The Catholic Church for example bases theirs on country statistics - if a country is deemed ``catholic`` then 90+ percent is counted as being catholic - even if they are not, or if they have had their names removed.

It was, if you can see, for the first 2 rounds, the first person who gets the correct answer received a times-infinity bonus because all others are given 0 points. My work with the current scoring system is to encourage people to KEEP ANSWERING after somebody has got correct, and as the same time KEEP the privilege of the first correct-getter. As you can see, owing to this new scoring system, the amount of answer-scripts have risen dramatically. I wonder if the 1-extra-point system will bring any negative effect to the future competitions. It is because each question carries different amount of points, and the first-answer will lose his or her advantage. Instead, I suggest that a multiplier is to be kept instead of replacing it with an addition.  :Also, to encourage more replies, I've also given bonus multipliers to the second and third persons who get the correct answer.

But if you consider all the other conditions of the fibering conjecture, it's not allowed.  H_1 infinite means there's a non-separating surface; irrreduciblity means it can't be a sphere.  Compressing the surface gives a pi_1-injective surface, so the 3-manifold group contains a surface subgroup, which can't be the case if it's the integers (since the sphere is excluded).  Actually, the conclusion that the manifold fibers implies that the group contains a surface subgroup.

What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.  Regards,    It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as ``experimentation`` what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as ``leet`` are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?     So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.     OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the ``be bold in editing`` tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.

True to say that but totally irrelevant: most voters in 1935 understood National Labour to be in effect Conservative, and it was only the Macdonald family which thought of it as being Labour. What the SN says when giving examples is no more definitive than a newspaper article and I absolutely refute that it is 'authoritative'.  :The reason why swing is used for Conservative and Labour only and not for any other parties is that it doesn't work properly for others.

The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar.  The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro.   The statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that ``most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church``, but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.  You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918.`` This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church`` it is not balanced.

To advise ``government`` you are advising the prime minister.  Nothing states that Palmer ever met the prime minister, but he spoke to members of the parliament.  Rothbard is perhaps no political scientist, but there is a major difference between them.  Even under the American system, if someone speaks to members of the Congress, it would be dishonest to write that she or he had come to Washington to ``advise the government.``  We had reached a compromise and Rothbard indicated that he could live with it, but he has now gone in without any reason and changed the entry to be misleading.  The agenda at work seems more to defame a person than to provide neutrally articulated information. The issue is raised and it's time for Rothbard to simply back off.  Others here will have to revert his attempt to introduce errors into this entry.   `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2065, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 2432, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3085, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3808, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3904, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3963, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 944, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 703, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 259, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2064, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 24770472, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 24836735, "2": " Italic textBold textWE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!!!!!!!

When I find them I will put them in. But for now as reprinted in my book Super Cosmos p. 25 on Amazon My discovery of the recently observed SUPERSOLID was published in PHYSICS LETTERS Vol 30A, No 5 3 Nov 1969 months before Nobel Prize Tony Leggett published his similar prediction. The title of my paper is ``DESTRUCTION OF SUPERFLOW IN UNSATURATED 4He FILMS AND THE PREDICTION OF A NEW CRYSTALLINE PHASE OF 4He WITH BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION.  Pages 23 -26 have quotes from real BIG SHOT physicists about my work that someone vandalized because it refuted their libel or slander and smears that I am merely a ``kook`` and a ``crank`` and a ``crackpot`` - these are not personal attacks? Huh?  ``Dear Jack: Congratulations! What greater pleasure can a physicist have than see a long range prediction finally come true. David`` David Finkelstein on March 26, 2005.  Finkelstein emeritus from Georgia Tech  Also on Feb 16, 2005  ``Jack, Your solid He4 superfluid paper is wonderful! You actually did something once of very great importance - and apparently you did not realize this. This paper is a precursor to quantum gravity, and much more important in that regard than string theory (you can quote me). George`` George Chapline, Jr Ed Teller's Golden Boy at Lawrence Livermore for many years, PhD in physics from Cal Tech.  ``To whom it may concern, The Glogower Susskind paper of 1963 which introduced phase operators for a quantum oscillator was in direct response to discussions between Glogower, Susskind, and Jack Sarfatti. Sarfatti's contributions were significant. The correct attribution should be to the 'Glogower, Sarfatti, Susskind' operators. Sincerely, Leonard Susskind`` Professor of Physics, Stanford University written on Dec 31, 2004  All three of these reports were vandalized off the article on me and replaced with a false claim from I think Chris Hillman that my co-worker Alexander Burinski in Moscow said that my formula  B(curved spacetime tetrad) = (hG/c^3)^1/2'd'(Goldstone Phase of Higgs Field)  was nonsense. Burinski refuted that false allegation allegedly made by Chris Hillman? Instead they let smears by alt.Kooks and other unqualified people stand in a prominent place and erased the above remarks by important physicists! Now that' the truth.  Now as to my Goldstone paper with Stoneham later head of Theoretical Physics, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, Didcot, Berks (see photo in my autobiography ``Destiny Matrix`` on Amazon. The American Institute of Physics in 1980 or so published a Resource Letter on Symmetry in Physics citing that paper as noteworthy.  You can ask Ray Chiao at Berkeley Physics Dept on how my laser filament paper influenced his early experiments. You can ask Creon Levit at NASA AMES about out oft-cited paper on applying Bohm's quantum potential to molecular structure computer simulations.  Nobel Prize physcist Brian Josephson has been similarly smeared like me because of his interest in the paranormal and cold fusion. Even John Wheeler has been smeared because he uses literate language and metaphor that rankles the hacks who can barely formulate a sentence and hide behind unreadable jargon. To say I use jargon is Pot calling Kettle Black. I am a much clearer writer than most.  Finally my paper explaining the universal slope of the Regge trajectories of the hadronic resonances as tiny Kerr black holes with strong short-range gravity G* ~ 10^40G on 1 fermi scale was published by Herbert Frohlich in 1973 in his journal ``Collective Phenomena``. It caused Abdus Salam (Nobel Prize) to invite me to ICTP in Trieste, Italy 1973-74. You can ask historian of physics Jagdish Mehra about that. He was there. BTW I was tutored in group theory at Cornell by Robert Brout who I later met again in Brussels in 1973 when I visited Prigogine. Yuval Neeman and others in Israel are working still on this idea connecting QCD to strong short-range gravity. You can also ask Eshel Ben-Jacob head of the Israel Physical Society about me. No, Wikis for shame, for shame! This has been a vicious smear against me perhaps politically motivated because of my national security work. I do not know, but others may well find out. Also my adventures in the weird - paranormal, UFOs have been part of a long-standing covert intelligence operation involving American, British, French, Israeli and other Intelligence organizations. Some of this is explained in all three of my books since 2002 all on Amazon.

Your side makes out that it's just a slur aimed at the Israeli government, and then you complain that it's also used for other Zionists! Lots of people call expansionists ``Zionists``, not just neo-Nazis and ``Islamists``, although they are well represented as doing so on Google. And few people would use the phrase ``Zionist terrorists`` who aren't so describing the government and armed forces of Israel (and it's true that the combination is unlikely to be much seen in mainstream work, because it's rare that governments of any kind are described as ``terrorists`` in mainstream publications). But the phrase is used, and it is used by people outside those mentioned. And it's not necessarily true that it has ``fallen into disrepute`` (more original research  you simply will not source any of this stuff, will you?) so much as it has never been much used. I don't doubt that. There are relatively few ``Zionist terrorists``. Given the nature of terrorism, that's hardly a surprise.

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.  Slim is not a ``he``. Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?  She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.  Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.  Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.  So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.  This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.  The BUAV is not a ``controversial organisation``. It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become ``controversial`` just because you don't share it.  Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints -   But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.  thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.  I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.  As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.  First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.  Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.  Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.  Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.  I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.  If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.  ''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a ``copyviolater`` trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreem", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1507, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1614, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1521, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 273, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1424, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1591, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 797, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 737, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 402, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 311, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 26061571, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 26066681, "2": "`         ``Asori`` Refers to Assyrian.  ``Sooriatsi`` refers to Syrian.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1162, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1459, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 159, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1492, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1549, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 49, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 103, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1566, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 63, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 711, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 26066681, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "random"}, {"1": 26071450, "2": "  ==Kuomintang Assets== Today, yesterday, in recent weeks, there has been heated discussion in Taiwanese politics on the return of KMT assets to the government.

If the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up, then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a ``Other topics about Jesus`` towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of.  I propose that we condense these topics:  1. Chronology (which is under life and teachings, and we could include a reference to this article's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section) 2. Background 3. Names and titles 4. Ethnicity and physical characteristics 5. Artistic and dramatic portrayals  And then, since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom, but is now gone, we can get rid of it.  Also, since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the sub-topic in more detail, we can get rid of many of the other sources.  This should substantially reduce these sections: 1. Notes 2. Sources and further reading 3. See also 4. External links  After this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter.

Even among Christian ``believers``, the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the ``other``. Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all ``conservative`` churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2388, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3841, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3826, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3069, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 298, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2688, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 332, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2043, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2296, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1039, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 27165050, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 27182322, "2": "  ===Map Request=== This article would be better with a map of the Angevin Empire.

Also, the contrast between Category 1 through 2 might be increased some, it's hard to tell the difference, though white vs. yellow is fine.

Anyway, it appears that arguing with you would be fruitless. Do whatever you wish. \u2014    Thank you for your permission. I find the current ``Japanese grammar`` article very hard to grapple with. There seems to be a lot of detail in some places and then great big gaps in other ones. For example there are lots of examples about ``jibun`` and ``are/sore/kore`` but on the verbs it says very little relatively speaking, and there is lots of rather dense stuff about historical Japanese and ``sumite`` becoming ``sunde``, and the use of the names like ``renyoukei`` and ``kami ichidan doushi`` which actually don't mean very much - basically it has too much terminology. I was originally thinking of editing  Japanese grammar into what I thought would be a better form, but after a few trial edits and test questions I felt rather concerned about the response I would get, so I decided to avoid trouble by doing minor edits only on the Japanese grammar page and creating supplementary articles for the things I wanted to add. I would like to aim for simplicity and unity and focus in the supplementary articles. I hoped it would be a reasonable compromise, and here even you suggest splitting the Japanese grammar page, but if you object to the articles I have made I suggest detailing the problems rather than merging. Also I wonder why you thought of merging my pages, when the page Japanese language has a grammar section which is extremely bloated, and really does need to be merged into Japanese grammar. If you want to merge something, I would suggest the most in need of merging is the great mass of untamed and unfocused edits on Japanese language#Grammar rather than my modest pages which are fairly well-focused and form a valuable supplement to this page in my opinion.  ==Annotated bibliography and references== Anybody care to chime in with content for this section?  Anybody?  )  -    == Stem forms ==  Hello, I wonder if there was some particular reason why the order of the stem forms does not follow the standard order of \u672a\u7136\u30fb\u9023\u7528\u30fb\u7d42\u6b62\u30fb\u9023\u4f53\u30fb\u4eee\u5b9a\u30fb\u547d\u4ee4?  Anything I read about these six forms always states the forms in that order (and if it is classical Japanese, \u4eee\u5b9a is replaced by \u5df2\u7136, the perfective), and in fact dictionaries simply state the six forms of a particular verb etc. in that order without specifying which is \u672a\u7136, \u9023\u7528 etc.  I think the forms here should be put in this standard order.   03:03, 2005 May 13 (UTC)  :No objection from me. Go ahead! Incidentally, it would be more accurate to call izenkei the realis rather than the perfective. Note that the classical perfect forms -tari, -nu, etc. attached to the ren'youkei. Also cf.

I have not read Dyer's books, but from what Node_ue says, it seems to me that he's just a crank. He appears to have no clue in linguistics.  I don't think a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish, compare the resulting texts and get to the conclusion: ``yep, we have two different languages``.  Also, he uses made-up expressions such as ``sovetul (sic!) de deputa\u0163i`` or ``cuvinte slujitoare`` to prove his points, which is akin to data fabrication in regular science.   :Bogdan, Dyer did not come to the conclusion that Moldovan and Romanian are truly separate languages. :With regards to the parallel translation, he says ``the greatest difference between these two texts are in the vocabularies and in the styles they employ. There is a more 'flowering' prose in the Moldovan text... to reiterate, the difference here is one of style, not one of substance``.  :: Actually, ``le style est l'homme m\u00eame``, as Buffon once said. Dyer starts from the premise that the style in each country is homogenous: it is not, there are much more differences between different individuals in the same country. His ways of studying language is just as useless as the way the Nazis studied genetics by assuming the homogenity of the Aryan race.    ::: Yes, that's his point. That nearly all of the differences between the two passages are not differences between two languages, but just because two different translators. ::: Earlier, you said ``...a sane linguist would take two random people, put them to translate a text from Yiddish...``. Actually, he got these comparisons from published translations in ``Romanian`` and ``Moldovan``. He didn't just walk up to random people on the street.    :The only actual possible grammatical difference he finds in the texts is Moldovan ``pe tot ce vretsi``, and Romanian ``pe c\u00eet vretsi``. There were very few web results for ``pe tot ce vreti`` (about 5), and one of them was from the Zdob shi Zdub website (a Moldovan band). There were no results in Moldova for ``pe cit vreti``/``pe cat vreti``. So that may or may not be valid. I personally would say ``pe tot ce vretsi``. But I don't know if it's real.  :: I suppose this is part of an expression, such as ``jur pe tot ce vrei`` or ``pun pariu pe tot ce vrei``. Anyway, both sound common enough in Romanian and sounds pretty subjective choosing one for Romanian and one for Moldovan.    :Now, neither of those expressions is ``made up``. He takes both from M. Bruchis' work, ``one step back, two steps forward`` which is also quite critical of the notion of an independent Moldovan language.  :: But can this author prove they exist? Probably not, since no google hits are found.    ::: Michael Bruchis, you mean? I'm sure he can. He's an expert, too. He wrote an entire book on the subject. Just because no Google hits exist doesn't mean an expression isn't real  do you find any Google results for cit vreti%22+site%3A.md or cat vreti%22+site%3A.md? Or even tot ce vreti%22+site%3A.md? No, you don't. But that doesn't mean that nobody says those things in Moldova. How many results do you find for ``instrumente gramaticale``? 37, and none of them are at .md websites. You can find the word ``cuvintelnic`` on Google, but does that mean it's really the Moldovan word for ``dictionar``? No, Moldovan ppl only use that word when we're joking. (dexonline.ro finds 0 results too). Just because a term occurs or doesn't occur on Google, doesn't mean it is or isn't real.    :``sovetul`` is not a misspelling. Rather, it's a Soviet-era spelling  ``soviet`` was spelt as ``sovet``. Some Moldovans still spell it that way although it's usually considered incorrect; however he is quoting the phrase from Bruchis, who published his work a bit earlier when the spelling was still accepted.    :I agree with your opinion.

Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?  Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.``  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.``  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.``  The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.``  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.``  The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.    Wikipedia's cons use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.  Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html  Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.

The USA\u2019s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html  3. The Pledge\u2019s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  The Pledge is part of the USA\u2019s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.  As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.  Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.  Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their ``Nationalist`` and ``New Nation`` magazines, the ``Nationalist Educational Association`` and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book ``Looking Backward`` was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.  In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.    After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.  Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the ``Nationalist`` magazine, and he preached what he called ``military socialism.``  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.  The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the ``Wholecaust`` (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers' ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4021, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4020, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1708, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3040, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 680, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3378, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1561, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1612, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1585, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4036, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 29155472, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 29157258, "2": " ::::I have undone Karmafist's block and blocked you myself for 48 hours, for harrassment of multiple users and for ignoring warnings and appeals.  |  ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3257, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3261, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3209, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3204, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2975, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2813, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2756, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2126, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1684, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 389, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 29157258, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 29186752, "2": "  == Hasankeyf/Temp ==  Stub for new article... \u2014\u00a0 ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 792, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3253, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2995, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 715, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2937, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2684, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3862, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2616, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2891, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3857, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 29186752, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 29190509, "2": "  == Personal Attack on you ==  You probably know about this, but just in case:  diff. \u2014\u00a0 ", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 268, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2789, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1069, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1065, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1044, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2756, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3153, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2574, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 493, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3150, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 29190509, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 29193349, "2": "  :  Oh, I am sorry, I was looking at a previous edit.

Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.  The letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (``Mucho``) Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. ``Pierce, please,`` she'd managed to get in, ``I thought we had``  ``But Margo,`` earnestly, ``I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,`` or something.  ``For God's sake,`` she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.  ``Why don't you hang up on him,`` Mucho suggested, sensibly.  ``I heard that,`` Pierce said. ``I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow.`` Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down.

I've voted on some of them, mostly because other editors have solicited my input (I think with more confidence in what I would opine than is merited).  My votes on those have been mixed, and have depended on how specific the topics are, and whether I think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion.  But I'm neither one of those people who votes ``keep`` for anything with the word ``Jewish`` in it; nor am I an editor who votes ``delete`` whenever I see the word (we have some of each, and I think both are acting with a bit of bad faith).  :I am, however, very offended by abuse of the administrative systems of WP in violation of WP:POINT.  I guess you're a newbie, and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures.  We all start out that way.  In actual fact, there is a ``criteria for speedy deletion`` that allows removal of pages that have been previously deleted by AfD.  There are a lot of rules floating around, and they are not all consistent with each other, so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing all, or even most, of them.  :But an AfD is for a very specific thing, and something very different from your spurious nomination.  FWIW, Arniep also violated WP:POINT by massively nominating ``Jewish Foo`` lists that he actually wanted kept.  And he got blocked for 48 hours (rightly) as a warning.  What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.  And it is not a way to get even with editors who voted ``delete`` on some other page that you believe is conceptually equivalent to the page you nominate.  :There are lots of pages that I think should be better, and where I think the editors are putting in material that is not encyclopedic, and where the structure of the article is not optimal (maybe it needs refactoring into subpages).  As a good WP citizen who follows Wikiquette, I raise those issues on the article talk pages.  I attempt edits to the page directly.  Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.  What I do not do is nominate pages that I think cover worthwhile topics for AfD as a way of bullying the editors whose edits I do not like.  :If you follow Wikiquette, you'll get along with people here, and be a productive editor.  If you violate it, you'll make lots of enemies, increase general animosity, and fail to get anything done.

I'll go over a couple of them.  ``Character assassination is the Karl Rove tactic of choice, eagerly mimicked by his media surrogates, whenever the White House is confronted by a critic who challenges it on matters of war. The Swift Boating is especially vicious if the critic has more battle scars than a president who connived to serve stateside and a vice president who had ``other priorities`` during Vietnam.`` \u2013Frank Rich in the August 21, 2005 New York Times[3]  This is purely about Karl Rove, and the opinion writers thoughts on Karl Rove's tactics.  It  offers no meaning or insight to swiftboating.  ``Swiftboating Cindy Sheehan``[6] ``Swiftboating the Crazies``[8] ``Swiftboating again``[9] ``Dean is being swiftboated.``[10] ``I do think the race offered one good opportunity for out-of-state Dems and Progressives, and that was to calmly write to newspapers and try to talk to receptive radio hosts about the swiftboating of the candidate.``[11] ``I\u2019m glad the efforts to swiftboat Paul Hackett have been exposed for what they are.``[12]  These are all blog entries which may or may not contain the word swiftboating.  They serve no purpose other than to push a political agenda.  Swiftboat ('swift bOt); transitive verb: (1) To accuse a public figure of questionable conduct without the benefit of physical evidence, usually by an entity informally associated with a person or entity benefiting from the accusation. Noun: (2) An unsubstantiated charge made against a public figure or organization, usually made by a proxy entity. See also: Smear, hatchet job, character assassination. (3) An organization dedicated to swiftboating on behalf of a respectable organization. (4) archaic: a type of boat used by the United States Navy to patrol the shores of Vietnam from 1965 to 1970; see also PCF. [14]  This comes from some password protected forum.

For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.   In short, while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid, the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings.  Lift (force)  Anyway, hope this helps.

In this case the Wikipedia:Controversial_blocks page.  The copy below has emphasis provided where the admins in this situation are failing:   Wikipedia:Controversial blocks From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  While blocking IP addresses responsible for anonymous, clear-cut vandalism is routine, many other uses of IP and username blocks are contentious. Where consensus proves elusive, such blocks are damaging to the community.  The most controversial blocks are blocks of:  * suspected ``sock puppets`` or ``reincarnations`` of banned users * logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions,' regardless of the reasoning for the block * blocks made under the disruption provision of the blocking policy. * blocks that, while possibly wise, lack policy basis.  Once you are convinced that a block is warranted, the recommended procedure for | controversial blocks is:  # Check the facts with care. # Reread' appropriate parts of Wikipedia:Blocking policy. # If possible, contact other administrators informally to be sure there are others who agree with your reasoning. The administrators' noticeboard, IRC and email are effective tools for this. # Place the block, exercising due care in the wording of the ``reason``  message, and include a link to the user page of the user being blocked. # Place a notice of the block on the talk page of the affected user, with additional rationale, outlining the facts and the part of the blocking policy you feel applies. # Be willing to discuss the block with other Wikipedians. Such discussion usually takes place either on the blocked user's talk page, or the administrators' noticeboard (the latter especially in those cases where it was already raised there).  Block wars, in which a user is repeatedly blocked and unblocked, are extremely harmful. They are a source of frustration and disappointment to many seasoned Wikipedians and tend to encourage further bad behavior on the part of the blocked user. Avoid them. Instead, discuss the matter, and try to reach a consensus.  If no consensus has emerged after several respected Wikipedians have reviewed the matter, the user should be left unblocked. `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2519, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -2.0, "wi": 3518, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1053, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3652, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2679, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2680, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2681, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3158, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1507, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2658, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 30854280, "tg": 0.3}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 30864588, "2": "   It looks like the various links have been removed now.

The Fans had records on db (Danny Beard = db records).  Their single ``True,`` in particular, is a fantastic distillation of half of what Athens would be (avail. on ``Squares Blot Out the Sun,`` a db sampler).  Vietnam was never recorded.  The Fans split up, with Kevin Dunn remaining about the scene as a solo act (Kevin Dunn and the Tribe of Women were on db).  Alfredo Villar, the singer of The Fans, went back to his day job.    The other thing is Pylon.  There just are    not     words for how important they were/are.  REM's favorite band is Pylon.  The B-52's favorite band is Pylon.  Everyone's favorite band was/is Pylon.  The other huge starting point is in Atlanta.  The Hampton Grease Band, despite being Atlantans, was a kick off to the whole idea that we could be weird and successful.  Although they claim that ``Music to Eat`` sold fewer albums than any in Columbia history (not true, as a Yoga instructional record undersold them), they looked successful to us because they had integrity and played and got to pay their bills that way.  In particular, although that band's career was very brief, Bruce Hampton never went away.  Both in The Late Bronze Age and Aquarium Rescue Unit later, as well as the various incarnations as Hampton B. Coles and Colonel Bruce Hampton, he was a magnet for musicians.  Furthermore, Glenn Philips, who played guitar with the Grease Band when he was 15 years old, stuck around and continued to gig.  I'm a stinkin' expert on Athens 1980 - 1986.  After that, I quit my band and wandered away to academia, but I was one of Them back then.   `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1449, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1026, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3171, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2172, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2377, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3158, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3164, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3066, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2574, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 3169, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 30882961, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 30885412, "2": "or violate the 3RR rule, ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3783, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3863, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2682, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3781, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3920, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4118, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3662, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3779, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 828, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1328, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 30885412, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 30900621, "2": "  == Swastika edits ==  Hello.

Beyond that, you should understand that all these points of view about ex-German places that are part of post-1945 Poland have been made, aired, discussed, contested and reiterated ad nauseum on Wiki during the past couple of years.  My own view is that these places were known to most of the world by their German names for a long time, which should be explained where RELEVANT, i.e. in any historical section. This is especially true of Danzig/Gdansk, given its unique history in the interwar period and internationally high profile politically. A secondary point is that these places where known to their INHABITANTS by their German names before 1945.  There's nothing revanchist or revisionist in naming places with the names by which they were known to the world and to themselves during the historical periods involved. Indeed, it is linguistically revisionist, in a sense, to refer to Danzig (for example) as Gdansk when writing about the six centuries in which it was inhabited mainly by Germans.  I've argued all along that the Germans today should refer to these places by their Polish names when referring to contemporary events \u2013 for the same reasons that they should be referred to by their German names when historical events are the issue.      ==", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1750, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1746, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 360, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1784, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1045, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3222, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2918, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3171, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3195, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1089, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 31087332, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 31087522, "2": "`  Glenn, it is not true that I\u2019m removing FreeStyleFrappe\u2019s additions all the time.

On the note of safety procedure, my friend managed to get a 'sun burn' from the high intensity light.  ==Electrode ``Cleaning``,==  is commonly performed by grinding (shaping) the tungsten electrode into a fine, burr-less 'pencil point', using a high speed diamond abrasive wheel. The shape, and angle acuteness of the point, also plays a role in the 'focused' shape of the plasma arc.  The DC arc largely applicable to ferrous metals, benefits from using 2% thoriated tungsten (or 2% ceriated tungsten, an alternative to the radiological concerns of Thorium), while nonferrous metals such as aluminum and magnesium requiring AC current, are performed best with pure tungsten allowing the tip to melt into an enlarged balled surface at the end of the electrode.  A ``ball-point`` subsequently flares the arc onto a much broader surface of the material, where greater expansion and distortion must then be accommodated, or anticipated as part of the welders job.  ==More Cleaning==  There's cleaning or shaping of the electrode, and then there's cleaning or ``preparation`` of the work-piece to be welded:    As you say, dirt, oil and scale are simply removed from parts for a good weld.  Washing, degreasing, rinsing etc, but mechanical abrasion is fast, easy and most popular as shaping a weld chamfer can be done simultaneous to ``cleaning``.   AlumaPrep (or some brand name like that), is simply an acid rinse to remove stubborn anodizing and any last marks of finger print oil from the 'touchy' AC needing metals.  But as Triddle pointed out in his explanation of +/- wave form capable machines, the plasma itself will often do a fine job of burning off simple surface impurities.  Deep inclusions (ubiquitous in sand casted work) are a frustration all unto themselves.  Welder (the person) tolerance, patience, and experience must often judge what level of weld quality exist after cooling.  High-tech work, demands that the work piece billet is good stuff to begin with, yet there is a variety of filler rod that can be used to accommodate persnickety base material.  Nickle, Bronze and ``Everdure`` (brand name) are often blended into filler rods, and greatly assist the welder trying to fix cracked engine blocks or other sandy and oil impregnated work pieces.  Reactor vessels of all types, be they nuclear or cellular, are also a field unto themselves.  As the physical strength of a finished weld may really be the lesser of engineering concerns.  Chemistry plays a role in both questions of what will actually be held in the vessel, and how it may be cleaned between use.  Low carbon 316 SS (316L) commonly desired for biomedical applications where autoclaving and bleach will still kick the ass out of Stainless Steel.  Titanium and its many grades are like wise a subject for deep thought, but once the decision is made...  it works like soft butter, and few other welds can look so nice raw.  ==As to the safety stuff.==  A hot horse shoe is hot, and most animals with any brain will let go of it before they get burned too bad.  Therefor, direct and immediate sensible surface heat, is far less of real danger than the intense UV of the plasma arch as Gaiusjuliuscesar talked about 'sun burn', often called ``flash burn``.  Fully covering any skin, just as one might wish to reduce sun burn.  It's the same stuff.  Welders, responsible ones, will even clear a room of bystanders, even ones who ``know not to look into the light with out a hood``.  Side vision (looking off to one side) doesn't work either, as the cornea and retina damage (not dependent on center of focused vision) is extremely painful when experienced, (ya, I know) and not felt for many hours after excessive exposure.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 759, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 736, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 292, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 234, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 180, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 97, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 821, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 913, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 953, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 724, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.9, "wi": -1, "ri": 31294933, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 31296078, "2": "  I understand the point, but many if not most of those cogizant of the issue do not believe it has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and many observers believe the opposite.

I came out of the exchange feeling attacked as well. We seem to have had a cultural misunderstanding. I'll refrain from the practice of using that word as such in this environment (on Wikipedia). This is the only personal attack I remember anyone bringing to me. If you have others, please tell me. Otherwise, please stop saying that I am attacking anyone.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a `` snitch `` in American.

If you can find the time, I urge you to go into the ``history`` of the poppers section or page (click on the ``history`` tab at the top of the page), and then go to the bottom of that page. There you can click on the largest number, and essentially see ALL the history of this page  from the day it was created!  I just spent time looking at it, and a clear pattern emerges. To be kind, there are some pranksters among us. More realistically, and at worse, they are vandals. Some of them appear to be working in concert with each other to make arbritary changes to the edits of people they don't agree with. They literally  and very quickly  'revert' the versions back and forth among their own versions, all the while essentially vandalizing the credible information that more knowledgeable people have posted. Then, when the unsuspecting editors realize something's going on, that their edits are being deleted almost within minutes of their having posted them, and when they try to figure out how best to react and deal with the problem, as they begin the inevitable complaining and asking of questions, they are harrassed and threaten with having their accounts 'blocked'; or they're falsely accused of violating various rules of Wikipedia, upon which they are often then threatened with even more sanctions against them.

Thank you for for smoothing out the blocking issue, and, especially, for hearing me!  As to arbitration: well, it sounds nice in theory, but I worry the actual good it'd do and how I'd probably be the one to get smacked down. At the risk of sounding, er, slightly paranoid, my style apparently makes me a magnet for All Bad Things and there is not much I can do about it. It seems as if Dominick can do and say anything, repeatedly, and nothing happens, but I get admonished (or blocked!) for sarcasm and things I didn't even do.   While I was blocked (which incident is forgiven): in the ``external links`` section at the entry ``Rosary,`` he replaced this link with this one, calling the former a ``monograph site`` (by which he means, apparently, that there is one person who oversees thing  even though I have SIX people and he has been informed of this. If there's anything in the rules about monographs, I'd like to see what the heck Dominick is talking about). Malachias111 (my ``meatpuppet``) had my back, but man, oh, man!  I just want for him to leave me ALONE, to quit libelling me and my life's work, and to stop taking down perfectly relevant, helpful, and informative links just because he hates traditional Catholicism. Dominick is a ``POV Warrior`` with a a neo-conservative Catholic POV who engages in harrassment and a soft form of ``vandalism`` (though I don't think his purpose is to imperil the integrity of the encyclopedia, he is removing perfectly good content for no good reason  and lying about that content in the process). If he wants to go through and put the line ``a traditional Catholic website`` after any link to my site, then fine. But removing the links, replacing them (esp. with lesser quality links), lying about them (he says they're a ``blog,`` ``POV,`` ``monograph,`` 'linkspam,`` etc.), slandering me and the site in his edit summary notes, etc.  I can't just let him do that.  If you can give me decent odds that I will get a fair ``hearing,`` if the abritrators will read my RfC and the associated discussion page, click on the links, and look into what I have been saying, then I would very much like to move forward; but, if the odds say it's going to be a matter of their looking at style over substance (e.g., seeing my admitted sarcasm after months of weirdness and not looking into the reasons for it), then , I dunno 'cause I can't take another ``Oh, great, he wins again!`` type situation.   I will try to be more civil as it is apparently defined, but if it weren't for sarcasm, I don't know how I'd survive this stuff. If you knew what I'd been tempted to say, you'd think I were Mother Theresa LOL   In any case, I thank you for your attention. It's good to know I am not being totally ignored in all this and that someone out there is actually hearing me. No, it's beyond ``good``; it is a RELIEF as this has been really upsetting and time-consuming for me. I appreciate your time and know it can't be any fun for you either; I make my own self sick repeating my defense over and over LOL. Wish I didn't have to.   I saw earlier, though, that there are things going on in your ``real life`` that were, at least, to take you away from administrating until after Christmas. I hope that, whatever those events may be, they are happy ones. Assuming the odds are decent and this goes forward at all, if bringing all this up to an arbitration committee is too time-consuming or distracting, it can wait 'til after Christmas when you have more time.

Jesus told Thomas, ``more blessed is he that belives without first seeing``. I have posted an article by Pastor David Bay for you to read which explains in detail the prophecy of Jesus's comming.  THE UNPARALLELED PRECISE PROPHECY  Daniel 9:24-26, ``Seventy weeks of years, or 490 years are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city Jerusalem, to finish and put an end to transgression, to seal up and make full the measure of sin, to purge away and make expiation and reconciliation for sin, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint a holy of holies. Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until the coming of the anointed one, a prince, shall be seven weeks of years, and sixty-two weeks of years; it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times. And after the 62 weeks of years, shall the anointed one be cut off (killed) and shall have nothing and no one belonging to and defending Him...``  The remaining one week is found in verse 27, and refers to the last seven years of earth's history, the period which we know as the ``Great Tribulation``.  The term ``Weeks of Years`` was a common Jewish term. It meant literally seven (7) years. The term comes from God's commandment in Leviticus 25:3-4 to farm a piece of land for only six years, allowing it to lie fallow for the seventh. This seven-year period came to be known as a ``week of years``. Therefore, Seventy Weeks of Years was 490 Hebrew years.  Note this prophecy contains three parts:      1. 7 Weeks of Years (49 Hebrew Years)      2. 62 Weeks of Years (434 Hebrew Years)      3. 1 Week of Years (7 Hebrew Years)  At the precise point in history when the 7 + 62 Weeks of Years occurred, Israel could expect Messiah to announce Himself as Messiah. What great news! This means that Israel could not miss Messiah. All they had to do was to count, be cognizant of current events in Israel as they unfolded, and be aware of this prophecy.  This study will show us several things:      1. Why the Wise Men knew the time for Messiah was close.      2. Why Israel missed Messiah.      3. How this applies to us today.  Let us now consider the meaning of the prophecy.  I. The Duration of the Prophecy  This prophecy stipulated that Messiah would be presented to Israel and would be killed after 69 weeks of years had elapsed from the specified starting point. When we multiply 69 times 7, we understand that the time involved here equals 483 Jewish years. Since the Jewish calendar contains 360 days, we can easily see that God is talking about 173,880 days. Therefore, we can expect that 173,880 days after the prophecy started, the Messiah would present Himself to Israel as Messiah-King.  II. The Starting Point of the Prophecy (Daniel 9:25a)  In this verse , God said the prophecy would begin ``from the going forth (the issuing) of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem...`` At the time God gave Daniel this prophecy, Israel was a slave nation under Babylon; however, God had foretold that this slavery would last only 70 years. This 70-year period was rapidly coming to a close; indeed, non-Jewish history records that the Medo-Persian emperor Artaxerxes issued such a decree on March 14, 445 B.C. Therefore, precisely 173,880 days from this day should bring us to some significant event in Jesus' life which presented Him to the nation Israel as Messiah.  III. The Mathematics Of The Prophecy  A. The First Seven Weeks (49 Jewish Years)  If you study the book of Nehemiah, you will find the account of the Jewish pilgrimage to rebuild Jerusalem following King Artaxerxes' decree. The prophet Nehemiah assumed charge of this rebuilding effort, which was carried out in such extreme hardship and danger that the builders carried swords with them as they were building the walls. Thus was fulfilled precisely the prophecy in verse 25b,``...it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times.``  This effort began in 445 B.C. and culminated in 396 B.C., exactly 49 years, just as foretold.  B. The Second Period (62 Weeks of Years, 434 years)  Daniel 9:26 foretells that the ``anointed One`` would come after this period and would then be killed. This wording is understood by most conservative scholars to refer to Jesus Christ, not at His birth, but at His presentation as the Messiah-Prince.

Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, I think it shows what I could scratch the surface with in about 10,000 words. Adding citations might bring it up to 12,000, but the ratios involved will always be subjective. I will never be able to get a million Jews to sign a statement that they are against Zionism, for instance, but based on the people I've talked to, I think that about 35% to 40% are. That percentage could be off, but I personally have talked to many people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds, from all around the world, who think that the methods of the Zionists are despicable, and who will not fight with the Zionists when the end comes and the sides are chosen.  ::::::If you believe President Bush when he says, ``If you are not with us, you are against us,`` then it looks like the sides have already been chosen. I don't think there's very many people with the side of the Crusaders and Zionists. If the only other position is against the Crusaders and Zionists, then I feel comfortable with the numbers of my side during the upcoming apocolypse.  ::::::I started this article because someone in al-Qaeda asserted that al-Qaeda is the same as the Front. It isn't, so I changed the al-Qaeda article to more accurately describe it as a subset of the Front. After that, people wanted to know what the Front was, so I started this article. I didn't put the original reference to the Front in the al-Qaeda article; I merely clarified it. There are a lot of groups in Islam that don't like the United States or Israel. I realize that its easier to combine many of these groups into a general idea when talking about them, but thinking of the larger International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders, which is really more of a movement, as the same thing as al Qaeda, is perhaps too much of a generalization. You could generalize the World Islamic Front as loose enough to be the same thing as the International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders except that the World Islamic Front only has Islamic members. That means that most of the people in Bush's ``against us`` category could not be part of the World Islamic Front.  ::::::Your assertion that ``bin Laden certainly would have no part of such a front as you describe,`` is absolutely untrue. bin Laden isn't a racist. He encourages any group that helps his cause and has often appealed to American and Jews to control the crimes being committed in their names by their leaders.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2649, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 3363, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3986, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3437, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3746, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3968, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1099, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2593, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 2691, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4141, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 32031828, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 32065626, "2": "  What is the protocol for dealing with these things, so that no one else uses them ?

One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by ,  and  because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by  This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???.  For me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this. * History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn\u2019t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia. * Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called \u201cNorthern Greece\u201d. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)! * One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn\u2019t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc. * Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name. * Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.

In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.  ==Systems of punishment== On , we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced ``time out.`` In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on  saying, ``Good call.`` Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.  We can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.  When we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.  ===Prescription=== Language requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and ``misuse`` would soon render that language ineffectual.  Within the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

Do you claim to know which sources people are allowed to read about in the article, based on which ones are considered ``canonical``?  Does it really matter who ``historians deem`` any of sources - whether the ones you personally approve of being mentioned, or the ones you don't - to have genuinely been written by?  They are all definitely ancient sources, and they were all definitely written by somebody - whether it was the person they were ascribed to, or someone else.  The only possible basis you have for mentioning some and not mentioning others, would be based on certain of them having been declared ``frauds that must bve suppressed`` by various councils of Bishops.  Wikipedia is not bound to avoid mentioning them at all, just because some council of Bishops wants them to be suppressed.  Bringing up what historians say is a red herring, because as you well know, plenty of historians can be found who say they are ALL frauds, hence there is nothing alongside historians to differentiate one set from the other set.  The only differentiation comes from your personal beliefs, or from the declaration of some council.  And please note, we are just mentioning them in the article as existing  not stating which ones are ``true`` or ``untrue``.  We've clearly stated that they aren't part of the canon. It's wrong to pretend they don't exist, and to suppress all mention of them, based on which ones you, bishops, or even historians personally might feel are ``untrue``.  They are noteworthy simply because they are ancient.      `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 985, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2988, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2979, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2507, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2117, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1314, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1227, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 271, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1146, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 159, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 32494311, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 32504823, "2": "Horace Mann does have the best Model UN team in the country.

American Canine Association (ACA) \u2014 ``America's largest veterinary health tracking purebred canine registry.`` \u2014 Note: In the ``Find A Puppy`` section of their website, dog/puppy seekers are referred to pet/retail stores. Very little information is available on the website regarding their goals or mission as a registry.   American Purebred Registry (APR) \u2014 The APR issues registration certificates for dogs and cats. They start a pedigree file with the information the owner sends them. Once APR accepts an application, a registration certificate is issued and the animal is considered registered. APR is a record keeping agency only and does not sponsor dog shows, field trials or competitions of any kind. On the application, the owner certifies that the dog or cat is a purebred representative of the breed. They take the owner's word for it and no proof is required.   America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) \u2014 ``An internationally recognized association of responsible pet owners, breeders, distributors, veterinarians, retailers, pet product manufacturers, and other concerned parties dedicated to the humane care of animals, the preservation of quality bloodlines, and the individual's right of pet ownership.`` APRI recently re-incorporated as a for-profit corporation. \u2014 The APRI promotes and encourages the sale of dogs and cats through distributors and retailers. ``America's Pet Registry, Inc. was begun as insurance for the pet industry...`` ``APRI offers free dual registrations on dogs from reputable registration services to professional breeders. We classify a professional breeder as one who has three or more breeding females and who regularly sells puppies in the pet market.``   Animal Registry Unlimited (ARU) \u2014 Some statements found on the opening page of their website: ``We register all pets and animals.`` ``We guarantee that your pet or animal can be registered with us.`` ``Providing a registry for the development of new breeds of useful pets and animals. Unlike many organizations we encourage the development of new breeds.``   Continental Kennel Club (CKC) \u2014 Note: This registry is also known as the CKC and should not be confused with the Canadian Kennel Club \u2014 These are two completely separate registries.) \u2014 The Continental Kennel Club recognizes 450 breeds as purebred. The Continental Kennel Club has a section known as ``Miscellaneous Breed Registration`` which allows for the crossing of two purebred parents of different breed types to produce hybrid puppies. Registered as MISC/BREED1-BREED2 and isolated from purebred registrations, they are distinguished from other breeds on registration certificates by having ``non-purebred`` printed on their registration certificates. In addition, the Continental Kennel Club has a section within their club for developing new breeds. Stock used for these breeding programs is listed in the ``Development Class``. The Continental Kennel Club has implemented a classified section on their site where club members can advertise their breeds. If you have a look at some of the more popular breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, some of the kennels advertising there include breeders of cock-a-poos and other crosses. The Continental Kennel Club's website provides very little information regarding their goals or mission as a registry. For more information, however, there is a very thorough web page at: Continental Kennel Club FAQ.  - Continental Kennel Club Rules & Regulations   Dog Registry of America (DRA) \u2014 (Formerly the US Kennel Club) Statements directly from the Registry's home page: ``DRA Registers rare breeds and exotic breeds.

To get this figure, you probably included all organic content in the lithosphere, as if there was a remote chance to gzet anything usable from a 5 km deep shale with 1% of kerogen. You got confused ``light oil``, and ``conventionnal oil``. what you categorized as ``low-grade oil`` is, for a large part, not oil at all (kerogen).   Second, there is a important notion you ignored  net energy yeld. The vast majority of low grade fossil ``fuels``, like deep oil shale, would consume more energy to extract than they would give. Already, the Athabasca oil sands have a self-consumption of about 30% - that could be reduced to some 25% with advanced technology. The small-sclae oil shale projects that were teste had a near-zero net energy yields - except in estonia, but the shales they used were among the richest known.  Third, extraction rate is as important as reserves. Non conventionnal oil (biodegraded oil, bitumen, oil heavier than water...) is very difficult to take out. Kerogen from shale is even worst. Even if these ressources are in the trillions of barrels, they won't provide much help if we can only get a few million barrels out per day.  Fourth, non-conventionnal has an high environmental cost. CO2 emeissions on a full-cycle basis (from well to end use) are much higher. There are other problems like the destruction of ecosystems (for open-pit production of both oil shale of oil sands), water use (especially for oil shale), water pollution, disposal of wastes (for oil shales)... These environmental costs would become catastrophic is non-conventional production was to be upscaled to the same range of output than current conventional production.`", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2588, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1031, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3207, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 566, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 568, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 569, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3258, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4265, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4274, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4082, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 32882552, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "random"}, {"1": 32894429, "2": "`  :What I dislike about your proposed version is that it doesn't carry the forms / aspects distinction which was the point of my proposal.

The ``aspects`` division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind. The perfect example is that of ``social conservatives`` who (can be) economically liberal without being socially liberal. :In any case, if the forms/aspects division is tossed, then I'd rather that those sections called ``cultural`` and ``political`` liberalism also be removed, or placed in a different section, since they already describe essential / noncontroversial issues within liberalism. :IIRC The only paragraph I ommitted was the last one about modern-day liberalism/lip service, since it was already discussed earlier in the section (and seemed out of place given the topic of this section).

It's a letter the Governing Body received in 1980 from the Watch Tower's chairman's committee, before the Governing Body disfellowshipped many senior Witnesses for ``apostasy``, and the reason was they were discussing these teachings below. I happen to agree with the points that disagree with traditional Watch Tower doctrine. You would also find it interesting reading Raymond Franz's discussion of each of these points in his two books, Crisis of Conscience and In search of Christian Freedom, and after see if you can still refute them using the Bible as your guide. The letter is below:   :Following are some of the wrong teachings being spread as emanating from Bethel. These have been brought to the attention of the Governing Body from the field from April 14 onward.  :1. That Jehovah does not have an organization on earth today and its Governing Body is not being directed by Jehovah.  :2. Everyone baptized from Christ's time (C.E. 33) forward to the end should have the heavenly hope. All these should be partaking of the emblems at Memorial time and not just those who claim to be of the anointed remnant.  :3. There is no proper arrangement as a ``faithful and discreet slave`` class made up of the anointed ones and their Governing Body to direct affairs of Jehovah's people. At Matthew 24:45 Jesus used this expression only as an illustration of faithfulness of individuals. Rules are not needed only follow the Bible.  :4. There are not two classes today, the heavenly class and those of the earthly class also called ``other sheep`` at John 10:16  :5. That the number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 is symbolic and not to be taken as literal. Those of the ``great crowd`` mentioned at Revelation 7:9 also serve in heaven as indicated in vs. 15 where it is claimed that such crowd serves ``day and night`` in his temple (naos) or K. int says: ``in the divine habitation of him.``  :6. That we are now living in a special period of ``last days`` but that the ``last days`` started 1900 years ago C.E. 33 as indicated by Peter at Acts 2:17 when he quoted from the prophet Joel.  :7. That 1914 is not an established date. Christ Jesus was not enthroned then but has been ruling in his kingdom since C.E.33.

The PNAC is part of a larger picture, and does not represent the entire breadth of the movement toward fascism in the United States, but it is a critical component of establishing a militaristic, nationalistic, imperialist regime in the U.S.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 610, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 639, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 467, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 427, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 574, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 422, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 598, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 542, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 474, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 514, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 33188499, "tg": 0.2}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 33193019, "2": "Sorry, I don't believe that", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1463, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1467, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1468, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2474, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2515, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 823, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 899, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 354, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1469, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 900, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 33193019, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 33236319, "2": "` *NOTE: My name is only spelled with ONE ``b``.

My view is this:  The evidence of direct anti-Romanian actions undertaken by the USSR in the 1920s is abundant. The convention of October 28, 1920, whereby the British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan recognized Romanian sovereignty in Bessarabia, was rejected as invalid by the USSR. Moscow even denied the validity of that part of the convention that stipulated that, upon Russian request, the Council of the League of Nations could be empowered to arbitrate the Russo-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia. In short, the Kremlin insisted that Romania was illegally occupying Bessarabia. And it was because of this intransigent attitude that the Soviet Union refused to make any concessions. Romania's attempts, in the early 1920s, to seek accommodation with the USSR on all issues except the Bessarabian fell on deaf ears as the Kremlin encouraged revolutionary activities by Bolshevik elements in Bessarabia. The establishment in October, 1924, of the Autonomous Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic as a focal point for eventual reincorporation of Bessarabia into the USSR indeed eliminated the possibility of peaceful resolution of Russo-Romanian differences.  The exact position of the USSR on these issues is unknown except for Moscow's unwillingness to make any concessions to Bucharest on Bessarabian issues. Recent tracts by Romanian historians have emphasized the support given by Romanian Communists to the ``democratic forces`` opposed to alteration of the status quo in Transylvania in 1938 and subsequent years. True as this may be, there has been no evidence presented in support of any fundamental change in Moscow's traditional anti-Romanian positions with respect to Bessarabia in 1938 and subsequent years.  Whether the Kremlin envisaged this entire scenario in August, 1940, is uncertain. But that this possible scenario was within the realm of Russia's long-range plans for Romania and Eastern Europe cannot be doubted. The Romanians were aware of Russian intentions throughout the interwar period, and the Hungarians were also conscious of the potential advantages to be derived from Russia's anti-Romanian attitudes in an eventual resolution of the Transylvanian question. And it is undeniable that the Romanians and the Hungarians remain aware of Russia's interests in Transylvania forty years after the Vienna Diktat.`", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1548, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1519, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 584, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1524, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 729, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 557, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 542, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 477, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1204, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1238, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 33248409, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 33249657, "2": "` **So, you ``don't want to express your personal opinion,`` yet in the same breath you express your personal opinion?

I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, ``A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others.`` The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.  :I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a ``rodeo cowboy`` to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd.

Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.      :People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  ( \u00a6 \u21d2\u2709)   ::It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you ``I've never done anything like this before, either``. Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.     :::Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda  :::I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for ``assortative mixing`` and ``risk tolerance`` maybe  or   ( \u00a6 \u21d2\u2709)  ::::I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying ``X does Y`` constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.     ::::Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.     :::::It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation.    ::::::The question is, is it actually a 'com", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 875, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 265, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 269, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 738, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 754, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 761, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 783, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 805, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 883, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 839, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 33647838, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 33685862, "2": "  :And as far as the ship's name goes, see her website: http://www.nol.navy.mil/homepages/cvn75/ : ", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 827, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 828, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 823, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 825, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3518, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 831, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 824, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 829, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 826, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 830, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 33685862, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 33707088, "2": "  :: Wesley just explained some of his, which is more than you have done.

Priority disputes on Wikipedia science pages are quite common (there's on on the Albert Einstein page as well at the moment), and what is required in all cases is to make sure that it can be demonstrated that Wikipedia is reflective of significantly notable points of view, and not fringe points of view. This is not to say that there aren't ways for non-mainstream points of view to be incorporated into articles, and is certainly not meant to imply the correctness of one view over another. So if I am suspicious, just take it into context that in most cases I am used to people trying to push little agendas when they insert priority dispute information like this into articles, and it is nothing personal against you.

Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.  Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.  ==Biography and music career== ===Early life and discovery=== Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (n\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song ``And They Call the Wind Maria``, from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.  Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.  In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.  ===1990\u20131992: Early commercial success=== Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990. Carey co-wrote all of the compositions on her debut album with songwriter-producers such as Ric Wake and Rhett Lawrence, and would continue to co-write nearly all of her material for the rest of her career.

If you're still not convinced, feel free to Google my username (purplefeltangel) or my E-mail address (bizzaleth@rogers.com). You'll find information dating back years, most of it consistent,. Where it isn't, it's because I avoided using my real name or faked my age to get by COPPA. In my vast online world, I have Oekaki accounts, a DeviantArt, an Advicenators account, several blogs, a LiveJournal, at least 15 Neopets accounts, forum accounts on Sailor Moon websites, a Wikicity, an Amazon account and many reviews to go with it, Fictionpress and Fanfiction.net, Usenet postings, and much more. My mom even has a blog. I've been on the Internet since I was eight  that's seven years, by the way, and in all that time there has never been any evidence that I'm not who I say I am. I've had voice conversations with many people and exchanged letters with others. Do you think I'd be able to pull all that off?  These kinds of accusations are not only hurtful, but libellious  and just plain mean. Didn't your mother ever teach you to think twice before you spread gossip?  Before you get defensive, please just tell me who told you this. I don't want to start trouble, just avoid any that this might cause me.

Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)  19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)  ::Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)    I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...    :I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these ``newbies``, but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it ``An Unearthly Child``).  20:39, 9 January 2006  ::The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.    ::: I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).    ::::The CBC profile I think used ``Out of the Ashes``, which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  \u2014  \u2022    The DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.    :That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006  ::I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.    It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is ``An Unearthly Child``. The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as ``An Unearthly Child`` is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.   \u2022  ", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1318, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2199, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2182, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2251, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 358, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2165, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 434, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 500, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1393, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 605, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 36028037, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 36038017, "2": "  ::: Actually in my last edit I didn't describe that correctly at all, (Please ignore it).

You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:  1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like ``Boss`` and ``roman`` , now? heh, heh, heh)  Reply:   2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.  Reply:   3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn\u2019t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics\u2019 world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I\u2019m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my ``mate``. Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn\u2019t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish\u2026  Reply:   4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the ``Roman`` you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it\u2019s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.  Reply:  5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I\u2019m sure you can, it\u2019s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman\u2019s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong  Reply:  6. I put the first Clayface after mentioning that the previous are important. Don't make me doubt of your reading skills. How ever Basil Karlo has been important on and off and he started the Clayface concept and we have to point that. You talked about context to me, marking the appearance of the 1st Clayface, as I did, is context.   Reply:  7. I could doubt words I used like hot, sexy, bimbo and many other, that I once and again asked everyone to edit if they don't happen to like them. But I think is safe to say their creators intentions were to make those female characters look like that. Didn't you notice the curves in the drawings? I dunno about you but for most guys that could be a hot bimbo. In both comics and series Harley has been portrayed as a slut, sleeping with her teachers for a better note, killing his lover without caring and even was hinted as a playful lesbian in Hush.

Therefore to suggest that   ``In the modern period, the King-James-Only movement is opposed to new translations precisely because they're officially-endorsed by ``mainstream`` Protestant denominations``.  implies a cause and effect relationship between the conclusions of the KJVOs and the basis upon which that reasoning was made, which is faulty.

THIS PAGE IS AN ARCHIVE.  Post replies to the main talk page, copying or summarizing the section you are replying to if necessary.  ==First section of history==  Is everyone ok with this part of the history?  If so we can go ahead and move it into the article and get started on the second part.  :In 1974, Tina Barber, of Shiloh Shepherd Kennel in New York State, began  developing a unique line of German Shepherds. Her goal was to preserve the type of  dog she remembered from her childhood in Germany; dogs who are good family  companions, exceptionally intelligent, mentally sound, big and beautiful - similar to  Chuck Eisenmann's dogs from The Littlest Hobo.  After years of selective breeding  and genetic research, she seperated her dogs from the AKC in 1990.  :In 1991, The Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club of America (SSDCA, Inc.) was incorporated.   Shilohs were originally registered dually through the FIC and AKC, but after  difficulty with standards verification, the SSDCA decided to open the first  Shiloh-only registry, The International Shiloh Shepherd Registry (ISSR). Due to some  documentation problems with the original ISSR registrar, a special program was  designed by The Complete Computer Place (TCCP) to process registry data for the ISSR. Since then more than 4,000 dogs have been registered with the ISSR. They also  maintain a database with over 45,000 ancestors in order to properly calculate various  factors within the limited genepool.  Thanks .:..:.    :Since there haven't been any objections, I'll go ahead and move this to the article so we can focus on working the second section.  I also hope to be able to expand and work on some of the other sections today to get closer to the Manual of Style guidelines and start setting this article up for featured article status. .:..:.    This may be too late, but I think the fact that the ISSR was started in 1991 should be made clear and also that the TCCP started to maintain the records in 1993. There are other statements in that second paragraph that don't seem quite right to me either.    :Not too late at all, there's no time when an article is considered ``finished``.  I did notice that some dates are missing, like the TCCP you mentioned.  You might want to consider rewriting it and then posting it on here before making the changes to the article since that seems to be working to prevent edit-wars. .:..:.     In response to the ``others`` statement that over 50% of the existing ISSR breeders left in '97-98, at Tina's request, I have reviewed the database and put it into a live web page that can be shared with the entire Shiloh fancy.  http://www.shilohshepherds.info/otherBreeders.htm.  I am also preparing other documented data pages that will clearly dispell the objections that have been raised by the ``other`` ``editors``.       == Response to Concerns Posted ==  I apologize for the delay in reponse.

There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister.   The genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans.   Mind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.  Genetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians.   The article that is basically claiming that Kurds are closer to Jewish populations than Iranians is incoherent and should be deleted because it is taken out of context and is from a non-primary and constricted source that has been widely disagreed with by the scientific community.  ==`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3343, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2493, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 635, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 616, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 85, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1619, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3829, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3404, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3910, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1479, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.2, "wi": -1, "ri": 37144574, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 37150608, "2": "`, 29 January 2006 (UTC) :::::::I will also support the above.  ``Modern`` will become ``unmodern`` soon enough.

The consensus definition of fact is ``something that can be demonstrated to be true``, in other words, ``something based on empirical evidence``. I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition ``fact``, that is, they would not claim that their views are ``built on empirical evidence``. Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user. The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect.

I'm mostly into classical music, but I'll take a peek at Smashed Gladys on your account. I would suggest waiting until you've been here at least three months or so, usually people are hesitant to grant adminship to someone who hasn't been here that long. When I said that  I loved awards and food, I meant WikiFood...like the cookies you see on my page. ;) I don't really have a problem with my weight. ;) Ciao! G  :I would definately second what  said below. I'm not saying you're a bad user, I've just not seen much of your work around. Who are you working with?  is not a registered user as of yet. I did look at your article you mentioned. If I remember correctly, it looked good, but as I said, I have no interest in rock/pop/jazz/etc., so didn't pay much attention. Joshua Bell, Itzhak Perlman, Julia Fischer, Midori Goto, and Sarah Chang are all young classical musicians, if you want a partial list of some. Ciao!G   == ``rank`` ==  Hi Pickelbarrel. Well, I'm a Wikipedia:Administrator, which means that, apart from the usual work of editing and writing articles I can do a few additional things associated with trying to keep the place running smoothly and cleaning up when it runs less smoothly. So I can (un)delete articles, (un)block account, (un)protect pages and edit protected pages within strict limits. That's all, though. Some people find these things useful, others are fine with never having those additional abilities and the responsibilities that come with them.  The actual process to becoming an admin is to make a Request for Adminship, in which the community will scrutinise your general conduct and work. Generally, the community does not grant adminship to users with less than 3 months of good contribution across a reasonably broad spectrum of activity. After all, if you're going to have the ability to help look after the place, you need to be well-familiar with how it normally looks and works. So you need to show that your responsible and trustworthy, civil when in conflict and that you have a good grasp of the various policies, guidelines and common practises. There's a lot of advice in WP:GRFA which you can look through. You can also read through the current nominations on WP:RFA and see the reasons people give for supporting and opposing requests.  You may find that your time on Wikipedia is entirely fulfilling without the additional admin tools \u2014 after all, you don't need any of them to actually write the encyclopedia. -  :Old successful nominations are held in Wikipedia:Recently created admins and old unsuccessful nominations in Wikipedia:Unsuccessful adminship candidacies.

The article needs to be rewritten or expanded such that it accurately graps ALL of the Charter, with references not only to its policies towards Israel, but its social and economic policies and ambitions as well.

The other option of course is to provide the link to the charter which can easily be read by anyone remotely interested in the document.

I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.  If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ```` link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ``Image`` from the dropdown box.

He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.  Blood group studies from the 1970's are not incorrect. This method has fallen out of fashion merely because it is less sensitive than the newer DNA method we have access to.  This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.    An example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere.   In general, you can measure the end-result of a person's genetic makeup by serological analysis (blood group tests), or you can measure the actual genetic makeup itself in the DNA. The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture.   The Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract. However, what they mean by ``significant`` is ``statistically significant``, not that a large portion of Sicilians' DNA is African. Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.  The Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found ``African`` admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.  The Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not ``problematic,`` as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and ``indels`` (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't ``refute`` or ``overrule`` the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study ``outdated`` or ``overruled`` or ``refuted``  all absolute drivel!  Lastly, the person who wrote this...  ``Lastly, talk of races is all hogwash in any event...``  ...should be aware that the person made the steward of all things Sicilian, the above-mentioned Racial Reality, is a proponent of the existence of races...just look at his handle.  I am a retired geneticist, and I do believe I have something valuable to contribute.  Incidentally, I am of partial Sicilian ancestry, and am proud of all who contributed to that great island's melting-pot population.

If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL.

Poor Chooserr does, on the other hand, and has been blocked for edit warring a few times. But the battle as to when the Gospels were written and as to whether Jesus really existed is being fought at  Jesus as well as at Historicity of Jesus, with one of the same editors leading the battle. I only came across the dispute quite recently, although the article was on my watchlist as a vandalism target. This editor insists on writing ``jesus`` (quotation marks, and lower case) all over the talk page, to make the point that Jesus wasn't a real person, and for a while he was adding a paragraph saying that there was no evidence that he had ever existed. I do recall reading that the agreement was that if articles already had CE, they shouldn't be changed to AD, and if they had AD, they shouldn't be changed to CE. I haven't found the relevant page. I think the dating of the Gospels is more important. I have Robinson, Tresmontant, and Carmignac in the house, but have only skimmed through them. They, as you know, argue for an early date. I can never work out how reliable Brown is supposed to be. Father Peter Straviskas, whom I trust, seems to think highly of him; Father William Most, whom I also trusted (he's dead now) considered him very unreliable. Going down to dinner now.

I am a veteran journalist, writer, and editor with many years of experience. Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing ``edit warring`` which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and ``revert warriors`` who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the ``one-way`` pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being ``disruptive`` in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while ``revert warring`` without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as ``proof`` of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several ``reverts`` on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to ``revert war`` - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been ``revert warring`` for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and ``reverters`` who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the ``complaints`` about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to ``use`` him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.    `", "6": [{"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2482, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 454, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1819, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1882, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 433, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2190, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2396, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2417, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2478, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1893, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.4, "wi": -1, "ri": 38714520, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 38719176, "2": "`. Some just make things up as if it substitutes for the truth, and use ``mistakes`` as ``proof`` of being ``disruptive.`` But, very few actually can cite facts, inaccurate edits, nor bother to even think about checking sources cited. It is much easier to ``complain about Theodore7`` and to ``revert`` since following Wikipedia's principles about biting newcomers is an ``excuse`` since it ``does not exist`` and ``does not happen`` to any newcomer. And, if they mention it - they are ``using`` it since it doesn't exist, etc., etc. This is just one of the many problems Wikipedia newcomers face with such people. It is so much easier not to care about any subject, nor to check sources (as I do as a journalist) and to find inaccurate and unfactual materials while avoiding POV. But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the ``revert wars`` by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful. So, if one is to gather evidence - show just where my edits are vandalism - where? I'd like to see it. Show my edit summaries. Show my edits, and don't cite my early mistakes as ``proof`` of being ``disruptive`` since I'd like to see someone claim they do not make mistakes themselves. Oh, one more thing. When a person defends themselves - try not to dismiss it as a ``diatribe`` - but actually read it in context and take responsbility for one's own ``claims`` against the person - in this case, a new member of Wikipedia. I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as ``proof`` of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred. Any arbitrator who wants to know more about my edits and comments can feel free to ask, or to view my comments IN CONTEXT and not TAKEN OOUT OF CONTEXT by some who are doing the constant ``complaining.`` I see no proof of any infactual edits on my part. And, my early mistakes are just that - mistakes that most newcomers to Wikipedia make. That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other ``revert warriors`` - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia. So, I've made inquiries elsewhere to make sure that perhaps this comes to an end, and that my case can be used as an example of what happens - negatively - to newcomers who run up against those who signed the RFC, and asked for arbitration. My evidence is there - my work to this time, my edits, sourcing, and using the Talk Pages - which I do not abuse, but use to add comments relevant to the subject at hand`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1370, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 4165, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3948, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2738, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3802, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 3379, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3184, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3020, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2739, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4169, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 38719176, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 38724613, "2": "  H.J.M, 8th February 2006.", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 910, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1811, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3942, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3941, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3891, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3827, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3479, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1794, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 621, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2707, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.0, "wi": -1, "ri": 38724613, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 38724797, "2": ".

Then it's just a question of time and taking notes and writing. :Since reading DNB biographies means not grading papers, it's fairly irresistible. -)   `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1686, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1428, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2440, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 749, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1009, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2809, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 560, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2598, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3093, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 200, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.6, "wi": -1, "ri": 38820904, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 38821888, "2": "   * i would try and be careful dealing with ytmnd. there is a good chance that this could spread to other topics within wikipedia on new topics and fads. maybe we can include some sort of reference to the SNG ytmnd so everyone is happy. otherwise i just think things like this will get worse.  <3 Dorkmo", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 287, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 489, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1612, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1629, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1643, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1501, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 561, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1680, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1327, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1353, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.8, "wi": -1, "ri": 38821888, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 38848580, "2": "  :Speaking as the person who created this article, I have to agree with the first user  I don't see the propriety in keeping the NFL team affiliations.

Your own words, and your edits are being scrutinized. So is your lack of good faith, among other failures to be balanced, kind, and true to history. So, keep up the very bad work on Nostradamus that both of you continue to do such as proclaiming that he is not an astrologer. Even a child who has read anything about the author of Les Propheties knows Michel Nostradamus was an astrologer - except, Peter Lemesurier, and Jiim62sch - who profess to be the KEY to all things known about Nostradamus, but who cannot even read a simple horoscope, nor chart of the celestial bodies. Perhaps this accounts for your bad translations, and even worse biographical ``knowledge`` of Nostradamus, of course, called an astrophile because he practiced astrology as a ``hobby.`` Great work PL, but it doesn't hold water. Word has been out on Peter Lemesurier for years about his lack of astrological knowledge, and even less on Nostradamus, and most scholars avoid his work because of the errors, and poor scholarship to boot. This reflects even on the German-version of Nostradamus which PL has ``edited.`` One of the worst cases of scholarship on an encyclopedia on this subject; which is why he keeps putting out numerous books on Nostradamus.

If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.

I have never given money to the IRA, I am Irish Catholic and I support Sinn Fein, but not the IRA. I personally do not believe the IRA are terrorists in the same veign as the UDA/UVF, Hezbollah or Al Qaida. The IRA is much more like the Iraqi Kurds, Northern Alliance, Jewish Irgun, French Resistence, and American Revolutionaries. I am also not a UDA/UVF terrorist apologist as Jdorney seems to be.  I also resent being banned just because some wanna-be administrator is upset that my article contains more accuracies then his does. I have re-edited my article and placed all the proper Sources, page numbers, and Quotes. I have also added to the ``Sources`` index. I have never ment to purposely delete anyones work, if I did so it was by accident and I apologize. I spent weeks researching this article, and alot of it is based on an article I wrote on the IRA when I was stationed at Camp. Pendleton back in 2000, the rest of it is from newer sources and books.  I certainly don't mind other people adding to the article, but I don't think that my edits should be deleted, just because they don't ``fit`` with the bias of some editor's and administrators.

You gave a good answer to my question concerning the Roman tactics of bringing provinces into the Empire, and I read your similar question, and I may have an answer for you. There are a couple of major reasons as to twhy Alexander was able to take his army so far in so short a time. Alexander had the advantage of inheriting a great army from his father, and the Macedonian Empire saturated with, I believe, silver.  Another major factor was the Persians  they had a large army of hundreds of thousands, mostly conscripted agaist their will and treated very poorly. When Darius was defeated, he actually was treated like a liberator, and could have easily not only absorbed the remnants of the Persian army, but gained more volunteers.

If you spot an error on a page, go ahead and fix it! If it's a big edit or a controversial issue, you may want to look at the article's talk page to see if the issue has been discussed in the past.

Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.  What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.  To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in ``enforcing`` wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your ``administrative`` tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse.

This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.  Here are a few of the questions and answers:  Some people say you are a divine incarnation, and some people say other things about you.  What's the truth?  You yourself must realize what is the truth.  So God cannot teach anything, except through a Master?  What is God?  You don't know what God is.  God cannot be a human being.  God is Light.  God is Power.  God cannot talk.  Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It's power.  Power cannto do anything.  It has to be put through a medium.  Why does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary?  Are you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs.  Is the living Master able to reveal Knowledge?  Yes, that's why you call him a living Master.   Guru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same?  At His time there were not so many doctors, that's why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That's why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature.  What happens to a person's karma when they receive Knowledge?  It starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you've got to go and be one with God.  Will this Knowledge save us from rebirth?  Yes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.    Guru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness?  ......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.    The lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it's a quote that reads:  ``I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.  Not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning, which has no end, which cannot be destroyed.  And I have that for you to experience.``  He signs this last quote:  ``Guru Maharaj Ji``  I maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or, at minimum, balanced by this evidence.  For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat's then-website wherein he said:  People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the ``old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes.`` I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, ``You need peace.`` When people said, ``Tell us of the scriptures,`` I said, ``Look within you.`` When people asked, ``What is your qualification?`` I said, ``Judge me by what I offer.`` To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same.   Long after Rawat was ``only eight`` he was playing games about whether or not he was God, he was saying that the reason he doesn't cure people like Jesus did is because we have lots of doctor", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 433, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2459, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2458, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1387, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2446, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1819, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1845, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2390, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2441, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2477, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 41827118, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 41854760, "2": "   == Image ==  There is a request for an image here, is there a particular qualifier for this?

Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:  :Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust.   :This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding ``sea level`` or ``liftoff`` thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:  :* Sea level liftoff thrust :* Sea level peak thrust :* Sea level average thrust :* Vacuum liftoff thrust :* Vacuum peak thrust :* Vacuum average thrust  :The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).  :When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.  :In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1534, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 311, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 273, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 233, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 679, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1528, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1522, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1461, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1198, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1029, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 41974296, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 41983132, "2": "  == Thank you! ==  Thanks so much for blanking and protecting my page.

If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.  If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

I am not quite sure how to categorize the photo of the Orange Bowl I uploaded. I took the photo on vacation a couple of weeks ago, so I guess it is mine. I would like it to be shared by the Wikipedia community (GDFL), but I'm not sure how to categorize it. Also, I successfully uploaded it to the Orange Bowl Stadium page, but didn't save it because I didn't want to butcher the look of the page. I'm still in the trial and error stage.  Any advice you have would be helpful.  Haaron755  == Running Late ==  Thanks for the advice, LD. I am running a little late and have to go to work, so when I get home tonight I will attempt to follow the instructions you've laid out. As far as the Orange Bowl page is concerned, I was able to upload the photo to the page without making the page look rediculous. I went to another wiki page, copied the edit code they used, and applied it to Orange Bowl. Worked like a charm.  I am a HUGE wiki fan and have a ton of photos to contribute from my travels. Hopefully you can keep an eye on me and walk me through any more problems should they arise.  Thanks again.  Haaron755  == Thank You ==  Hello.  Thank you for the info about the photos of Drs. Stone.  I just wrote to them and requested permission.  I am new to Wikipedia but I will strive to be a valuable and ethical contributor.

The fact that, during the final battle with Cell, Gohan was stronger than his father at a far younger age, shows that it's simply not true. Goten and Trunks were also both halfbreeds and, since they both acheived super saiyan at a young age, were both stronger then their fathers at the same age. Half-saiyans not being able to acheive Super Saiyan 3 is also pure speculation - since Goten, Gohan and Trunks all stopped training hard at the end of DBZ, logically they wouldn't have gotten there. In any case, Goku was the only case of SSJ3 to ever occur, so it's very fuzzy in the area. The real proof that it's wrong, however, is that Gotenks could go SSJ3. Though you could argue that the two 'saiyan halves' double over, making him pure saiyan, this wouldn't make sense from a genetic point of view. In other words, Gotenks was a half-saiyan and he went SSJ3, so there is no proof to say an unfused halfbreed couldn't achieve it if they became powerful enough.

In a context in which jurisdiction over language rights not specified by the Charter is undetermined, this means a conflict between Bill 2 and the North West Territories Act exists.  From the CanLII website:  ``Article 110 embodies procedural rules that give rights to individuals and, in fact, those rules are to some extent framed in terms of rights.  They are language rights or language guarantees as all the cases in this Court from Jones to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Acadiens make clear.  Section 110 was not entrenched after the Saskatchewan Act was passed.  This, like the continuation of s. 110, is entirely in accord with the legislative history of these provisions.  Many of the questions raised about the reach of the protections like those accorded under s. 110 have already been determined in recent cases before this Court either under s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867, s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, or ss. 16-18 of the Charter.  All of these provisions are differently drafted but they use similar expressions and there has been a marked tendency to give them a similar interpretation.  Section 110 was obviously modelled on s. 133.  The language rights accorded by s. 110 are substantially the same as those accorded under these other provisions: R. v. Mercure, 1988 IIJCan 107 (C.S.C.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234; Paquette v. A.G. Canada and A.G.

If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.  If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

By calling everyone under the age of 18 a ``child``, which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called ``children,`` and if you start using terms like ``teenage sex`` and ``teenage sex with adults`` to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the ``poor little abused children`` angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a ``baby.``  Then all sex with minors could be ``poor little babies being abused and raped,`` which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman's, John Ashcroft's, and David Finkelhor's of the world.

I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.  Regards,    *You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like ``Hogtown`` for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add ``Scandahar`` to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.  Given your edits to the article, you are probably better placed to make that call than I.

Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).  2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.  3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.  4. Added Sidhoji Rao Shithole's legal and proper name.

BusinessWeek also ranks major academic divisions/disciplines; all of the school's divisions ranked in the top five in all nine surveys of the past twenty years. The magazine has consistently rated the major disciplines of the University of Michigan Business School in the top five since it launched its biannual ranking of professional schools in 1988. Only three other business schools can make this claim.  When BusinessWeek Online announced its ``Top Ten Management Gurus,`` based on surveying executives worldwide, Michigan professors Dave Ulrich (rated number one), Noel Tichy, C. K. Prahalad and Michigan alumnus Gary Hamel, PhD 1990, dominated the list.  BusinessWeek'''s ``The Best B-Schools`` report of October 2004 ranked the business school sixth overall among the best business schools, and fourth in leadership for its training efforts. In the same report, under the ``Best and Brightest`` category for schools that produce graduates with the best skills, the business school ranked: *3 in Marketing  *5 in General Management  *7 in Ethics  *8 in Global Scope   In other BusinessWeek rankings, the MBA program was ranked: *2004 - 6 *2002 - 8 *2000 - 6 *1998 - 4 *1996 - 2 *1994 - 6 *1992 - 5 *1990 - 7 *1988 - 6  In its Executive Education Rankings, BusinessWeek ranked the business school: *2003 - 3  *2001 - 3  *1999 - 2  *1997 - 2  *1991 - 1   In the Wall Street Journal/Harris Interactive Survey Rankings (2005): *2 National School Overall Ranking *2 National School Marketing *4 National School Operations Management *4 National School for Recruiting Woman *1 National School for Recruiting Minorities *10 National School for Ethics  The Wall Street Journal/Harris Interactive Guide to Business Schools: Recruiters' Top Picks 2005, released in September 2004, ranked the business school: *1 national ranking - Top North American Schools  *2 in academic excellence for Marketing  *4 in academic excellence for Operations Management  *7 Top International Schools  *9 in academic excellence for Accounting  *1 for hiring minorities  *5 for hiring women   U.S. News and World Report (April 2004) ranked Michigan's Executive MBA program as the #1 public EMBA program. In its ``America's Best Colleges 2005`` report, Michigan ranked: *2 in Management undergraduate programs  *2 in Marketing undergraduate programs  *3 in Finance undergraduate programs   U.S. News and World Reports Departmental Excellence Ratings (2002) placed Michigan in the top five for strength ``across the board.``   U.S. News & World Report's Best Undergraduate Business Program rankings (2006) placed Michigan third, tied with University of California-Berkley. This is the highest rating for any public university.  The Financial Times' Special Report on Executive Education (2005, released May 2004) ranked Michigan: *3 in Program Design  *4 for Quality of Program Faculty  *Among the top 10 for Skills and Learning, Food and Accommodations, and Relevance of Teaching Materials   The Academy of Management Journal, in its most recent ranking (2000), ranked the faculty in the top two for research performance among business schools. The National Black MBA Association named the University of Michigan Business School the ``Outstanding Educational Institution of the Year`` in 2001. Hispanic Business'' magazine rated the University of Michigan Business School as one of the 10 best graduate schools in the nation for Hispanics.     ==Category==`", "6": [{"ts": 2.0, "wi": 165, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1198, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1168, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1809, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2285, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2808, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3097, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2194, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 356, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 363, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.9, "wi": -1, "ri": 45797138, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 45823702, "2": "`  :: PKE is mentioned already in the ``official recognition`` section!

I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.  If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ```` link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ``Image`` from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Image legality questions page.

Well, here's what I've done just now.   *Changed section heading ``modern philosophy`` to ``philosophical topics``, to move the article more in line with Lac's proposal. The text there still reads in a historical sort of way, but that shouldn't distract the presentation of the broader themes and ideas presented. A single paragraph in the philosophical topics section was transferred a section up into the historical section, under the subheading ``modern western philosophy``. *A bit of text in the rationalism-empiricism subsection misleadingly implied that Locke was a ``naturalist``, and Hume the first empiricist. This is obviously wrong, so I changed it.  Something problematic: the sentence ``During this era, religious philosophy did not play a large role in the struggles that occupied secular philosophy`` is either misleading (assuming ``secular philosophy`` to mean ``not on the face of it pertaining to issues of God, etc``) or trivially true (assuming the same to mean ``completely non-religious philosophy``). Assuming the former, and assuming we take ``this era`` to mean ``the Modern era``, it counts as a counter-example that Descartes was completely religious; that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations. Locke's generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion: the man thought atheists were not to be trusted, and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion. The more stark example of Berkeley, already mentioned in the text, is an understatement: it is not just his disputes with Newton, but rather, absolutely anything that Berkeley said, which could not be divorced from his religious views (including his theory of vision). Malebranche is another example. It's my impression that there wasn't a genuine ``cooling off`` from appeals to religion until the late modern period. So I recommend the sentence be scrapped.  `", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 168, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1553, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1515, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1512, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1503, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1453, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 724, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 557, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 446, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 187, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.5, "wi": -1, "ri": 46379139, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 46380452, "2": "  == What do you think of the site map approach? ==  What about creating a site map as was done for the help page?

I have not deleted any page you created to date; I am afraid I am not aware of the ``report on vandalism`` page you are referring to. You can likewise inspect the log of my deletion actions to confirm that I have not deleted any pages that you created. As for ``editing after discussing`` - I agree, but there is no rule that states all edits must be discussed first on the talk page, and indeed although I would agree on such a course of action where multiple users disagreed with a particular change it seems clear in this case it was merely you disapproved of any changes being made to the Wikiethics page whatsoever. Although blanking pages is indeed vandalism, the removal of text in the manner of editorial modification is certainly not vandalism. You cannot simply revert changes you dislike, I am afraid; Wikipedia does not work like that. Please take this as a lesson, as I will be forced to block you again if you continue such behaviour - and considering that many other admins apart from myself have blocked you on numerous occasions, eventually you may find yourself indefinitely banned by community decision.

As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written.   Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT:   ===Wikipedia is not a soapbox=== Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not: #Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a ``sympathetic point of view`` for every article. #Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: ``Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.``  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability. #Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small ``garage`` companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability. -  I understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  `", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 369, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2097, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 414, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3535, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2801, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2040, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1506, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 624, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 3462, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2241, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.8, "wi": -1, "ri": 47686406, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 47698461, "2": ", 9 April 2006 (UTC)  Stlemur if you really want all the nitty gritty information of Glitters case, then why don't you do what was suggested at the start of this debate and do a full court record of Glitter's trial.

I'm sure it doesn't mean that he isn't taking this process seriously.   So Pm_shef and Leotardo, and myself, we have 10 hours before all the editing noted above will totally cease. Pm_shef is to add his objective Kadis research, and Leotardo will have his two edits added, before the 10 hours expires. I will go and do that now.

You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the VP was a luxury (sic) version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979. It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

This does go along with my point that latin is used (MOSTLY, Almost always). If cyrillic was really official like it is in Serbia, then the Bosnian Wikipedia would be both in cyrillic and latin (like the Serbian Wikipedia it is in both). The Bosnian Wikipedia says that it uses the latin script for pratical reasons (such as: people do not have the cyrillic keyboard, etc.) Well this goes along with my point that it is not used as much. People do not have cyrillic keyboards like the people in Serbia.  :Offical newspapers in Bosnia are not in cyrillic. They are in latin. (Slobodna Bosna, Oslobodjenje, Ljiljan, Nezavisne Novine (For all ethnicities), neither are their websites. Cyrillic is most commonly used in Serbia.  :How are you going to use a Wikipedia Article to prove your point. Now where does it say that it is 100% correct. I had problems with the German Wikipedia on Bosanska Dubica, they claimed that Hrvatska Dubica and Bosanska Dubica were the same town/municipality. This is just crazy. Anyways I will never understand why people, who have no clue about where Dubica is or have never before heard about the town, write about it. My point is that people can write things on a biased level. They showed me websites as proof, but websites cannot be used as refrences in the United States for grammar school projects. Websites can never be trusted.  :I mentioned this before, www.google.ba uses Bosnian and Croatian in latin, but if you want to search google.ba in cyrillic then you have to click Serbian to search google.ba in cyrillic.  :I also looked at several different translation websites and found that if you want to translate into Bosnian, then you are translating into latin (Bosnian). However, for Serbian it gives you an option (latin or cyrillic).  :In the world Bosnian is viewed by Bosnians and by the rest of the world as using the latin script.  :Then explain to me why the Serbian template does not have latin and cyrillic.   :I would have to say that only Srpsko-Hrvatski should have both, but the languages that have split from Yugoslavia, should be chosen by its users.

First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:  :  :Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.  :And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:  :  :The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.  However, it doesn't say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three-reversion rule and trigger blocking!  It does seem a little Kafak-esque, don't you think?  :Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13", "6": [{"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1584, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": -1.0, "wi": 1028, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1265, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 195, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1218, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1128, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 351, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1082, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1918, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 842, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.8, "wi": -1, "ri": 48306153, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 48313145, "2": "`Hello.

Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk.  It wears thin.  To be honest, I don't want Turkey to join the EU. I want you and teh editors and admin that are like-minded to carry on with your actions. We need to perpetuate the misnomers and misrepresentation of the Turks. Forget the Royal Academy's exhibition last year about these people. We need to keep isolating them.

However, my statement was not only on Rockall, but the article in general including the map and your position that we need to copy the style of academic literature. Read it again and point out where I mention Rockall. I simply pointed out the fallacy in your argument for excluding Rockall (which from 1955 to 1972 was a possession and not anything like a county Sussex) and that your example again indicates overall how you would wish the article written.  As for Rjensen's comments, maybe he should then explain the various uninhabitable rocks possessed by Australia, the United Kingdom, and in particular the United States (e.g. Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Rockall, Baker Island, Howland Island, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island and all the other United States Minor Outlying Islands). Empire does not only deal with people and governments it also deals with territory and the status of the territory in relation to the possessing country.  Guinnog, as I said before, this stuff is really not worth starting an edit war over. If Gsd2000 wants the article a certain way and others support him, then they have every write to edit the article. Of course, considering that they can hardly answer any questions or points we may bring up (or maybe they just ignore them) nor actually give definitions to what constitutes kosher imperialism, trivialities etc then we should bring this debate to some forum or bringing in an admin (although by Gsd2000's comments he (or she) seems to be or thinks he (or she) is admin).

As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.  Doing so is extremely common - how many thousands of women, for example, take their husband's surname on marriage without getting their name changed by deed poll?  Changing one's name in this way is an entirely different thing from having one's Registration of Birth amended, where specific statutes apply.  From the GRO's website: ``Changes to the Register of Births are almost impossible to effect and generally are only done if it can be proved that a clerical or factual error was made at the time of registration.``  So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.  My understanding on the case of the transsexual who wanted to have her birth registration amended was that she wanted the gender changed (though I'm open to correction on this).

Foote. I'm the author of a treatise titled the Ultra-Space Field Theory. Every once in a while I google the USF theory to see if its found a home on any new websites. I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir.   The Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it. (My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute.

For example, Kentucky's hilly topography with many streams and rivers are typical of the South, but the ``United We Stand Divided We Fall`` motto is totally opposite of most ``State's rights`` mottos in the South.  Economically we area somewhere in between, having a better economy and population growth than most Midwestern states, but still behind true sunbelt states like Georgia, Tennessee or the Carolinas. Food and accent wise we are definatly southern.  As For Louisville,I think that the ``old stock`` native Louisvillians are  midwestern in accent and attitude, but Jefferson's County nearly doubled it's population from 1940-1960 with people mostly from south central and western Kentucky which really altered the culture. Econmoically, Louisville today has less of a heavy industry based economy  city than it use to be, but instead has employment concentrated in a few ``high tech`` automobile factories and in the service industry, making it less Cincinnati and more like Nashville. , April 20.`", "6": [{"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3034, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 75, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 264, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 2339, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 3381, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 2.0, "wi": 1215, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 646, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2370, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 1413, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 367, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.7, "wi": -1, "ri": 49213248, "tg": 0.0}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 49215587, "2": "Anytime you want a nightcap, tell me.", "6": [{"ts": -1.0, "wi": 474, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 465, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 248, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 606, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 29, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 495, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 642, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 598, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 511, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 601, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": -0.1, "wi": -1, "ri": 49215587, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "user", "3": false, "5": "blocked"}, {"1": 49240681, "2": " ==Hey== how ya doin fuck face? did u think you were safe? huh? did ya?

Al Qaeda would be a destructive force in Islam that most Muslims would reject without a problem, but still such discussion would belong in Islam.

(and please don't include this in the article). Let's do a calculation. The mass of the Earth is about 1024 times bigger than the mass of the hammer. Therefore, the acceleration of the Earth is 1024 times smaller than the acceleration of the hammer, so if the hammer falls through 1 m, the Earth will move 10-24 m during the same time. Such short distances, which correspond to an energy of 100000 TeV, are not probed even by the most energetic particle accelerators! Let's now do another calculation. Suppose we're dropping the feather. The hammer, which is presumably on the ground, attracts the feather with its gravity.

Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.  The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.  Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.  Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the ``real Jews``.  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.  Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.

I wish to express my utter apology for the poor standard of our tumble dryers that you recently have received. I assure you that the fault was not of the manufacturers, but of the transport company that we hire to deliver our products. The tumble dryers left our company in perfect condition, and therefore were not properly packaged into the lorries and were damaged in the journey. As for the colour schemes, we are to believe that the tumble dryers were being delivered along side some cans of paint and must have got mixed up along the way.  We will have a word with the delivery company to sort out the problem and so future deliveries should arrive in the high standard expected of our company.  In the meantime might we interest you in some exclusive discount vouchers on future orders. Find enclosed our brochure.  Your Sincerely      N Thorpe Complaints Manager   Ref.

However, I now see that the original Megatron IS listed under ``Animation villains``, as is Galvatron, despite both also being listed under their respective villainous Transformers factions, which themselves are listed as ``Villain groups``.  There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category ``Animation villains``.  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.  I mean, he created the Vehicons, and led them, but I don't think he really was one himself, no matter what form he was in.  So, I would really like to put him under the category ``Animation villains``, but I'm afraid someone would once again remove him from the category.`", "6": [{"ts": -1.0, "wi": 2001, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 1.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2006, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2057, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2230, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2265, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2626, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 2002, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 1852, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 1.0, "wi": 2630, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}, {"ts": 0.0, "wi": 4241, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.0}], "7": {"ts": 0.3, "wi": -1, "ri": 50997423, "tg": 0.1}, "4": "article", "3": true, "5": "random"}, {"1": 50998418, "2": " :Co-sign!

I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.  If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ```` link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ``Image`` from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page.

You do have a good argument, although I do not fully agree. The problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way. Since it is policy, you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia. The policies are there to create consistency. All you are doing now is making it more confusing. People expect to find the common names on Wikipedia, because that is the way it is done at the moment. Also, it seems you haven't read the Tree of Life guidelines properly. In it, it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names (such as birds) or there is a relatively unique common name. Otherwise use the scientific names. For example: White's Tree Frog is unique, and therefore the common name should be used. However, if you look at Litoria chloris, the common name cannot be used. Its common name, the Red-eyed Tree Frog has a disambigous page, explaining why that common cannot be used, and states that Red-eyed Tree Frog is not unique.  ::The entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people. If someone wants information on a snake, writes its common name into the search box, and comes across an article with a strange latin name, they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name, and it redirected to the wrong place. Especially if the article did not have a photo. If a scientist wants to look at an article, and puts in the scientific name, and it is redirected to the common name, they will be aware of what the common name is. In fact, you will find that in most scientific papers, they will use the common name, stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity. A lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name. There is no other choice, and there is no problem with this.  ::Please, bring this up on WP:TOL talk page before changing any more articles. You cannot create consistency yourself, and all you are doing is making it worse. If policy is changed other people can help, and it is possible to get all the articles changed. Policy needs to be followed, otherwise the encyclopaedia becomes a jamble. Thankyou.
