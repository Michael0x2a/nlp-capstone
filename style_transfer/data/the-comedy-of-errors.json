No\u2013the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse\u2019s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself.

Then my agent died and, obligated to care for my now untended goods abroad, I was drawn away from my wife\u2019s fond embraces. I hadn\u2019t been gone for six months when my wife, almost fainting with the pains of pregnancy, made arrangements to follow me, and she soon arrived safely where I was. She hadn\u2019t been there very long before she became the joyful mother of twin boys. It was strange: they looked so much alike that the only way to tell them apart was by their names. In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys. Their parents had very little, so I bought the boys and raised them as companions and servants for our twin sons. My wife was more than a little proud of our two boys, and every day she would press me to return home. Reluctantly, I agreed\u2013alas! Too quickly, we boarded a ship."

My wife, who was very concerned about the younger of our twins, tied him to a spare mast\u2013the kind that sailors use for just such a purpose. She tied one of the other twins to him. I did the same with the remaining two boys. With the children taken care of, my wife and I tied ourselves to opposite ends of the mast and floated off, obedient to the current. It carried us toward Corinth\u2013or so we thought. Eventually the sun, looking down upon the earth, burned off the threatening storm clouds.
