All the clouds that threatened the York family have vanished and turned to sunshine. Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads. We've taken off our armor and weapons and hung them up as decorations. Instead of hearing trumpets call us to battle, we dance at parties. We get to wear easy smiles on our faces rather than the grim expressions of war. Instead of charging toward our enemies on armored horses, we dance for our ladies in their chambers, accompanied by sexy songs on the lute. But I'm not made to be a seducer, or to make faces at myself in the mirror. I was badly made and don't have the looks to strut my stuff in front of pretty sluts. I've been cheated of a nice body and face, or even normal proportions. I am deformed, spit out from my mother's womb prematurely and so badly formed that dogs bark at me as I limp by them. I'm left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about that.\nthat"

If I don't answer, perhaps you'll think I'm accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me. But if I do speak and refuse your request, then I'm guilty of reprimanding my friends, who have been faithful and loving toward me.\nSo, I'll speak to make clear I don't want the crown but also that I am grateful to you. Here is my definitive answer: thank you for your love, but I'm going to have to turn down your weighty request because I don't deserve to be king. First of all, even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown - if it were truly my birthright - I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it. My spirit is poor, and I have so many terrible defects that as king I would be like a little boat tossed about on a mighty sea. So, thank God, there is no real need for me, as I wouldn't be able to help you much. The royal tree has left us other fruit, which, with time, will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king, I'm sure. Someone other than I has the right and the good fortune to be made king. God forbid that I snatch the crown from him."

The man I'm married to now came to me when he'd barely washed the blood off his hands from killing my first husband, that angel, as well as my husband's sainted father, whose corpse I was following to burial. I'm telling you, when I looked at Richard's face, this is what I wished: \"I want you to be cursed for making me a widow so young. And when you get married, let sorrow haunt your bed. And I hope your wife - if any woman is crazy enough to marry you - is more miserable about the fact that you're alive as you have made me by killing my husband!\" And then what? Before I even had time to repeat the curse, my woman's heart was taken captive by his sweet, slick words. I became the victim of my own curse. Since I married him, I have not had one hour's sleep in his bed. Every night I'm awakened by his\nterrified dreams. It doesn't matter if I sleep, though. He hates me because of who my father is. He will, no doubt, get rid of me soon.\nterrified"
