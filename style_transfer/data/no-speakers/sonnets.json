            "translated": "We want the most beautiful people to have children, so their beauty will be preserved forever - when the parent dies, the child he leaves behind will remind us of his beauty. But you, in love with your own pretty eyes, are letting your beauty burn itself out. You're starving the world of your beauty rather than spreading the wealth around. You're acting like your own worst enemy! Right now you're the best-looking thing in the world, the only person as beautiful as springtime. But your beauty is like a new bud, and you're letting it die before it can develop and bring you true happiness. You're a young man, but you act like an old miser - you're wasting your beauty by hoarding it and keeping it to yourself! Take pity on the rest of us, or this is how you'll be remembered: as the greedy pig who hogged his own beauty and took it with him to the grave."

Then, when someone asks you where all your beauty is - all the treasure of your virile youth - if you were to say that it's all there in your withered face and sunken eyes, that would be an all-consuming shame and nothing to be proud of. You'd have a much better excuse if, decades from now, you could say you spent your beauty and youth raising a child. If someone were to ask you why you looked so old, you could say, \"The effort I spent raising this beautiful child explains the sorry old state I'm in\" - and meanwhile your child's beauty would be a new incarnation of your own! Having a beautiful child would be like being born again in old age, with the blood that flows coldly in your old veins becoming warm again in his."

Your face is fresh and healthy now, but if you don't reproduce it, you'll be cheating the world and cursing a woman who would happily be your child's mother. After all, do you think there's a woman out there so beautiful that she'd refuse to have your child? And what man would be so foolish as to allow his own self-absorption to stop himself from fathering children? You are like a mirror to your own mother, and when she looks at you she can gaze back at the lovely springtime of her youth. In the same way, when you are old and wrinkled, you'll be able to look at your child and see yourself in your prime. But if you choose not to have a child to remember you, you'll die alone and leave no memory of your own image."

Nature doesn't give us anything; she only lends us the gifts we get at birth, and, being generous herself, she lends the most to people who are generous themselves. So, you beautiful miser, why do you abuse the bountiful gifts that were given to you to share with others? Why do you insist on being such a bad investor, using up the immense treasure you have to offer the world but unable to support yourself or preserve your memory? By only having dealings with yourself, you're cheating yourself out of the best part of yourself. Then how, when nature says it's time for you to go, will you be able to give an acceptable account of how you spent your time and beauty? Your unused beauty will have to be buried with you. But if you used that beauty now, it would stay behind once you were gone and preserve your legacy."

For never-resting Time takes summer by the hand, leads him into horrifying winter, and destroys him there - freezing his sap, removing his full leaves, covering up his beauty with snow, and turning everything bare. If we didn't have perfume distilled from summer flowers to keep in a jar, the effects of summer would vanish at the end of the season. Without perfume, we'd have no way of remembering the summer itself or its beauty. But the flowers used to make perfume lose only their outward beauty when winter comes; their beautiful scent lives on sweetly."

Make some woman pregnant and pass on your beauty before it dies with you. It's unfair to charge exorbitant interest on a loan. But if you lend a woman your body, she'll be only too happy to pay you back with a child. Having a child - making another version of yourself - will make you happy. Having ten children will make you ten times as happy. What power would death have over you if you left children behind to keep your legacy alive? Don't be willful and selfish - you're much too beautiful to be conquered by death, with nothing left of you but a corpse devoured by worms.\n(Continuing from Sonnet 5)"

And even at noon, once the sun has climbed the steep path to the top of the sky, it still looks like a strong young man in his prime and human beings still adore its beauty, watching it pass on its way like a golden king making a pilgrimage. But when the sun grows weary and falls from its highest point, it reels like an old man, and the people who once looked up at it so dutifully stop looking and turn the other way. In the same way, you, wasting your sexual energy in the prime of your life, will die alone and unloved unless you father a son."

So why do you love things that make you unhappy and enjoy things that are bad for you? If music played well and in tune sounds bad to you, it's because that music is rebuking you for not playing your own part - not making your own harmony - by getting married and having children. Notice how the sound of two strings vibrating together in harmony is like a father and child and happy mother, who all sing one pleasing note together. Though their music has no words, the unity of their voices sings this warning to you: If you stay single, you'll be a childless nobody."

The world will be your widow and weep forever about the fact that you didn't leave a copy of yourself. But if you had left a wife behind, she'd have had her children to look at and remind her of her husband. A person who wastes his money is just shifting money around - at least the money's still in the world. But if beauty is wasted, the world loses it forever: If a beautiful person doesn't use his beauty, he destroys it. The person who would commit such a murderous outrage on himself has no love in his heart for others."

For you are so possessed with murderous hatred that you have no problem plotting against yourself, seeking to destroy the house that you should want to repair. Oh, change your way of thinking, so I can change my mind about you. Should hate have a more beautiful home than love? Be gracious and kind, like your appearance - or at least be kind-hearted to yourself. Have a child out of love for me, so your beauty will live on in your children, if not in you."

The youth and vigor that you would pass on to a child now that you're still young, you could call your own when you're no longer young. In marriage and childbirth lie wisdom, beauty, and reproduction. Without them you have only foolishness, age, and the cold decay of death. If everyone thought like you, the human race would end, and in sixty years there'd be no more world. Let the people who aren't good enough to preserve - the rough, ugly, poor people - die childless. Nature gave abundantly to the people whom she endowed with beauty, and you should cherish her gifts by being generous with them. Nature made you her stamp, to serve as a template for all human beauty. She meant for you to make copies of yourself, so that the original - you - wouldn't die."

Who would let such a beautiful house fall into disrepair when prudent maintenance might make it outlast the stormy gusts of winter and the frustrating barrenness surrounding death?

I, who am constantly pestering you for sex, am more than enough to satisfy you, adding another willing penis to the Will you already have. Since your sexual desires (and vagina) are both so enormous, won't you agree just once to let me put my desire inside yours? Are you going to be attracted to everyone else's will (penis), but reject mine? The sea is entirely made of water, but it still accepts additional water whenever it rains. So you, who already have a William, should in addition to your lover William accept my will (penis), making your sexual appetite (or vagina), which is already huge, even huger. Don't kill an eager seducer by being unkind to him. Treat all your lovers as a single lover, and accept me (and my part) as part of that lover.\nWill"
