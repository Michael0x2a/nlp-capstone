I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was one of the\nBentivolii. It's only fitting that I, his son, reared in Florence, should concentrate on adding more virtuous deeds to my father's own, stacking them on top of his wealth. For this reason, Tranio, I'll study ethics and - for the time being, anyway - pursue those areas of\nphilosophy that teach a man how to achieve happiness through virtue. What do you think of all this? Leaving Pisa for Padua,\nI feel a little like a thirsty man who turns from a puddle to a vast lake he can drink from.\nBentivolii\n\n\n\nphilosophy\n\n\n\nI feel\n\n\n"

He's knock-kneed too. His bit's lopsided and his cardboard bridle, which breaks when you pull on it, is taped in a few places.
