Those oppos\u00e8d eyes,\nWhich, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,\nAll of one nature, of one substance bred,\nDid lately meet in the intestine shock\nAnd furious close of civil butchery\nShall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,\nMarch all one way and be no more opposed\nAgainst acquaintance, kindred, and allies.\nThe edge of war, like an ill-sheath\u00e8d knife,\nNo more shall cut his master.

England will no longer be wet with her own people's blood. War will no longer damage her fields, and warhorses will no longer trample her flowers. The soldiers on either side of this vicious civil war were countrymen and brothers, as similar to one another as shooting stars. They may have clashed recently, but now they will march together in beautiful formation, no longer struggling against family and friend. War is like a mishandled knife: it can cut its owner, but it will no longer cut us. My friends, we are now soldiers for Christ, and we take his blessed cross as our battle flag. We'll raise a new army of Englishmen and march all the way to the Holy Land. Our soldiers were born to chase non-believers from that holy ground touched by Jesus' feet - feet which, fourteen hundred years ago, were nailed to the cross for our sins."

Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly am no proud jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy - by the Lord, so they call me - and when I am King of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep \"dyeing scarlet,\" and when you breathe in your watering, they cry \"Hem!\" and bid you \"Play it off!\" To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action; but, sweet Ned - to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker, one that never spake other English in his life than \"Eight shillings and sixpence,\" and \"You are welcome,\" with this shrill addition, \"Anon, anon, sir. - Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,\" or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling \"Francis,\" that his tale to me may be nothing but \"Anon.\" Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent.",

Sirrah, I've made great friends with these three bartenders, and I'm on a first-name basis with them: Tom, Dick, and Francis. They swear on their souls that, even though I'm only the Prince of Wales, I'm the king of niceness. They say I'm no pompous fool, like Falstaff, but a good sport, a spirited man, a good boy. When I'm King of England, all the good men of Eastcheap will follow me gladly. When you drink deeply, they joke that you have been dyed red; and if you stop for a breath when you're drinking, they yell \"Cough!\" and they command you to keep going. In fifteen minutes, I got so good at being a drinking companion, I could be at ease with any man over a drink, in any setting. Ned, you didn't do yourself any favors by missing this. But, sweet Ned, I'll sweeten the name Ned with this bit of sugar, given to me by an apprentice\ndrawer who never spoke any English his whole life, except, \"That'll be eight shillings and sixpence,\" and \"You're welcome,\" and also, \"Just a second, just a second! Bring a pint of\nbastard to the\nHalf-Moon room!\" But Ned, let's pass the time until Falstaff gets here. Hide in a side room while I ask that little apprentice drawer why he gave me the sugar.

That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish-hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be asked. Shall the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest. For, Harry, now I do not speak to thee, in drink but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also.

Your mother says so, I believe so, and the wicked glint in your eye and foolish expression on your face prove it. If it's true that you are my son, then here is my point: why, since you are my son, do so many people point at you? Should the blessed sun in heaven waste its time eating blackberries? That is not a question worth asking. Should the son of the king of England become a thief and steal wallets? That is worth asking. Harry, you've heard of a substance known as pitch.\nPitch, as the wise men tell us, makes one filthy, and so does the company you keep. Harry, I speak to you not drunk but weeping, not in happiness but in anger, not just in words but also in sadness.

I'm not going to march through Coventry with them tonight, that's for sure. They march with their legs wide apart, as though they had chains on their ankles.
