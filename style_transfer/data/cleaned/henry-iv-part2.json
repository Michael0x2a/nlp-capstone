Rumor is a pipe\nBlown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,\nAnd of so easy and so plain a stop\nThat the blunt monster with uncounted heads,\nThe still-discordant wav'ring multitude,\nCan play upon it. But what need I thus\nMy well-known body to anatomize\nAmong my household? Why is Rumor here?\nI run before King Harry's victory,\nWho in a bloody field by Shrewsbury\nHath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,\nQuenching the flame of bold rebellion\nEven with the rebels' blood.

I make the wind my horse, and ride it from the Orient in the east to the place where the sun sets in the west, describing the events taking place in the world. I continually tell lies and I tell them in every language, stuffing men's ears with falsehoods. I say that things are peaceful when, in reality, concealed hatred is at work, hidden behind smiles of good will.\nAnd who but Rumor - who besides me - can make armies prepare anxious defenses, when in fact the world is uneasy for other reasons and there's no war coming at all? Rumor is like a flute. Guesswork, suspicion, and speculation are the breath that makes it sound, and it's so easy to play that even the common masses - that dim monster with innumerable heads, forever clamoring and wavering - can play it. But why should I describe myself in such detail to the one group of people who knows exactly what falsehood is all about: a theater audience? Why am I here?\nKing Henry has won the war, and at Shrewsbury, he ended the rebellion against him by defeating Hotspur and his allies, quenching the fire of revolt with the rebels' own blood. But what am I doing, telling you the truth up front? My job is to spread word that Hotspur in his fury killed Prince Hal, and that Douglas killed the King. I've spread this rumor through all the peasant"

The\nsecond property of your excellent sherris is the warming of\nthe blood, which, before cold and settled, left the liver white\nand pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice.\nBut the sherris warms it and makes it course from the\ninwards to the parts' extremes. It illumineth the face, which\nas a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little\nkingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and\ninland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart,\nwho, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of\ncourage, and this valor comes of sherris.

Hereof comes it that\nPrince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally\ninherit of his father he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land,\nmanured, husbanded, and tilled with excellent endeavor of\ndrinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is\nbecome very hot and valiant.

First, it rises into the brain and dries out all the foolish, dull, clogged-up fogs that have gathered there. It makes the brain sharp, quick, and inventive; full of nimble, fiery, and beautiful ideas. The voice and tongue give birth to those ideas which, when they grow up, become excellent wit. The second power of good wine is the warming of the blood. Before wine, the blood is cold and sluggish, and this makes the liver - the organ of passion - chilly and pale. A chilly, pale liver is the sign of cowardice and faint-heartedness. But wine warms the blood, making it course from the inner organs to all the extremities. The blood brightens the face, and the rest of the body - which is like a little kingdom in itself - takes that brightening as a signal. Then the spirits of the blood and all the internal organs gather together behind their captain: the heart. The heart draws strength from these followers and, enlarged by them, can accomplish any courageous deed. This is the bravery that comes from wine. Without wine, skill in weaponry doesn't matter. Wine is what sets that skill in motion. Education is nothing more than idle gold in the devil's hands, until wine rouses it and puts it to good use. That's how Prince Harry became valiant. He's taken the cold blood he inherited from his father and - like unproductive farmland - he fertilized it, planted it, and cared for it, through the hard work of drinking vast amounts of good and potent wine. And so now, he's become hot and courageous. If I had a thousand sons, the first rule of behavior I would teach them would be to avoid weak drinks, and get themselves addicted to wine."

If you look for a good speech now, you undo me,\nfor what I have to say is of mine own making, and what\nindeed I should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.\nBut to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you,\nas it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing\nplay to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better.\nI meant indeed to pay you with this, which, if like an ill\nventure it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle\ncreditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be, and here I\ncommit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will\npay you some, and, as most debtors do, promise you\ninfinitely. And so I kneel down before you, but, indeed, to\npray for the Queen.\nIf my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you\ncommand me to use my legs? And yet that were but light\npayment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience\nwill make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the\ngentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will\nnot, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen,\nwhich was never seen before in such an assembly.\nOne word more, I beseech you: if you be not too much\ncloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the\nstory, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair\nKatherine of France, where, for anything I know, Falstaff\nshall die of a sweat, unless already he be killed with your\nhard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not\nthe man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will\nbid you good night.",
            "section_name": "  Act 5, Scene 5, Page 6",
            "translated": "First, I'll tell you what I'm afraid of. Then, I'll bow, and finally, I'll make a speech. I fear that this play displeased you; I bow to you out of duty; and finally, I make this speech to ask you for forgiveness. If you're expecting a good speech now, then I'm in trouble. For I wrote the words I'm about to say, and I'm sure that what I'm about to say will end up getting me in trouble. But I'll get to the point, and thus I'll get to the danger. You should know - as you seem to - that I recently came on this stage at the end of some other lousy play, to ask you to be patient and to promise you a better play the next time. I had intended to pay you back for that play with this one. If you didn't like this play, then - like a businessman who has gambled on a risky venture - I am bankrupt; and you, my sweet creditors, are out of luck. I promised you I would be here, and here I stand to submit myself to your mercy. Give me some mercy and I'll promise to pay you back again another time. That's how debtors do it: they always promise to repay.\nIf my talking can't convince you to let me off the hook, then would you like me to dance? And yet, that would be a cheap payment, to dance myself out of debt. But a person with a good conscience will always seek to pay his debts, and I would do the same. All the women here have forgiven me: if the men won't, then the men don't agree with the women, which has never happened in a theater audience before.\nJust one more thing, if you don't mind. If fatty meat hasn't clogged you up yet, our playwright will continue the story with Sir John in it, and entertain you with the beautiful Princess Katharine of France. And speaking of France, as far as I know, Falstaff will die there of the sweating disease - unless, that is, he's already been killed by your low opinions of him.\nOldcastle died a martyr, and this is not him. My mouth is tired; when my legs are, too, I'll say goodnight and take a bow.\nOldcastle"
