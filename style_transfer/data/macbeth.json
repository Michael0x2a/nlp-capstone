Macbeth pitied Duncan\u2014after Duncan was dead. And Banquo went out walking too late at night. If you like, we can say that Fleance must have killed him, because Fleance fled the scene of the crime. Clearly, men should not go out walking too late! And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father? Such a heinous crime\u2014how it saddened\nMacbeth! Wasn\u2019t it loyal of him to kill those two servants right away, while they were still drunk and asleep? That was the right thing to do, wasn\u2019t it? Yes, and it was the wise thing, too, because we all would have been outraged to hear those two deny their crime. Considering all this, I think Macbeth has handled things well. If he had Duncan\u2019s sons in prison\u2014which I hope won\u2019t happen\u2014they would find out how awful the punishment is for those who kill their fathers, and so would Fleance.
