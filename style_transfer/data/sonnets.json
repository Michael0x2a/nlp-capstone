Inspire poems addressed to my beloved, the person who actually likes your songs, and who gives you both poetic skill and a topic to write about. Get up, sleepy Muse: Examine my beloved\u2019s sweet face to see if time has engraved any wrinkles on it. If there are any, then satirize aging and make everybody despise time\u2019s destructive powers. Make my beloved famous faster than time can destroy his life; prevent time\u2019s knife from cutting my beloved down."
