And there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that \u201ckeeping\u201d for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.",

And as you know, my father commanded my brother, Oliver, to make sure that I was brought up well\u2014and that\u2019s where my sadness begins. Oliver keeps my brother Jaques away at school, and everyone says he\u2019s doing extremely well there. But he keeps me at home in the country\u2014to be precise, he keeps me stuck at home but doesn\u2019t support me. I ask you, is this any way to treat a gentleman as nobly born as I am, to pen me in like an ox? His horses get treated better than I do\u2014at least he feeds them and trains them properly, and spends a lot of money on trainers for them. All I\u2019ve gained from his care is weight, which makes me as indebted to him as his animals on the manure pile are. He gives me plenty of nothing, and takes away everything else, letting me eat with his servants, refusing me what\u2019s owed me as his brother, and ruining my good birth with a poor education. This is what angers me, Adam. My father\u2019s temper and spirit, which I think I share, makes me want to mutiny against my brother\u2019s tyranny. I won\u2019t stand for it any longer, though I haven\u2019t yet figured out how to revolt.$NEWLINE$exactly$NEWLINE$$NEWLINE$$NEWLINE$"
