Well, I don\u2019t. If a man is always afraid of what others think, he won\u2019t even dare to dress nicely, because he\u2019ll be afraid people will talk about him. In short, since I intend to get married, I won\u2019t hear anyone say a bad thing about it. So don\u2019t go making fun of me for what I said before. Man is a giddy, flighty thing: that\u2019s my conclusion. And Claudio\u2014though I\u2019m sure I would have beaten you in our duel\u2014since you\u2019re likely to become my relative, I\u2019ll let you go, unbruised, and love my cousin Hero."
