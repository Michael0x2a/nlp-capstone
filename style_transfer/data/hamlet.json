In that fight, our courageous Hamlet (or at least that\u2019s how we thought of him) killed old King Fortinbras, who\u2014on the basis of a valid legal document\u2014surrendered all his territories, along with his life, to his conqueror.

Here, I give you my blessing again. And just try to remember a few rules of life. Don\u2019t say what you\u2019re thinking, and don\u2019t be too quick to act on what you think. Be friendly to people but don\u2019t overdo it. Once you\u2019ve tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them. But don\u2019t waste your time shaking hands with every new guy you meet. Don\u2019t be quick to pick a fight, but once you\u2019re in one, hold your own. Listen to many people, but talk to few. Hear everyone\u2019s opinion, but reserve your judgment. Spend all you can afford on clothes, but make sure they\u2019re quality, not flashy, since clothes make the man\u2014which is doubly true in France. Don\u2019t borrow money and don\u2019t lend it, since when you lend to a friend, you often lose the friendship as well as the money, and borrowing turns a person into a spendthrift. And, above all, be true to yourself. Then you won\u2019t be false to anybody else. Good-bye, son. I hope my blessing will help you absorb what I\u2019ve said."
